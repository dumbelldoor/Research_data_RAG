The accidental loads may be due to impact of vehicles, collision of vehicles, falling of objects on the structures floor, fire load and blast load etc.. Out of all accidental loads, recently bomb explosion on or above or near the structure made the researchers to do rigorous research on structures located in areas where terrorist activities are increasing day by day like the border between the countries, military area and lifeline structure. For the present study, A G+4 storey steel special moments resisting frame located in Zone II (important military building) is considered for the study. The structure is modeled using beam element and shell element in ETABS software and analyzed with considering gravity, lateral and blast load. The analyzed structure is designed for critical load combination to check the safety of the structural members as per limit state method. The ‘Y’ face of the building is found as weak face of the structure and which is decided from formed plastic hinges at the beam column junction due to non linear static analysis on each faces of the structure, iterations in ‘X’ and ‘Y’ direction due to PUSHX and PUSHY, lateral stiffness and second area moment of inertia and then the blast load is calculated for explosive charge weight of 25kg, 50 kg, 100kg at standoff distances 10m, 20m and 30 m as per IS: 4991-1968 and applied at each and every joint of weak face of the structure using triangular time history function. The progressive collapse or partially collapse or sudden collapse of structure is decided from the storey displacement results of maximum and minimum response cases and DCR values obtained for critical corner column. It is observed that for 100kg explosive charge weight and 10 m standoff distance there is a sudden or partial collapse of structures and the structure is susceptible to progressive collapse for case 2,3,6 and 7. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) surpassed others such as Whale Optimizer and Anti-lion Algorithms among the MAs. For the first time, GWO was utilized to build novel composite biodiesel from ternary oils (TSOs), specifically animal waste fat, cottonseed, and crude rice bran. As a result, in this study, (1) Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and GWO were used to model the novel composite biodiesel (NCB) from the CTOs, (2) the efficacy in terms of biodiesel yield (BY), and (3) the commercial viability of the produced NCB were investigated. The 94.2% of yield for NCB was obtained for RSM determined optimal conditions set at the methanol/CTOs molar ratio of 9, catalyst amount of 0.45 wt%, reaction temperature of 50 oC, time of 105 min. A quadratic model was developed to predict the biodiesel yield, with an R2 value of 0.995, indicating high accuracy. Grey wolf optimization technique optimized the biodiesel yield to 98.6%, corresponding to catalyst concentration, methanol to TSO molar ratio, reaction temperature, and time set at 0.53 wt%, 9.32, 60 °C, and 105 min. The predicted biodiesel yield was 99.18%, closely matching the experimental yield of 98.60%. 1 H NMR and FTIR provide insights into biodiesel's composition and chemical structure, ensuring its compliance with quality standards. The high-quality NCB obtained from the optimized condition ensures TSO can be employed for higher-scale production in industries and to run in diesel engines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Analysis of biodiesel; Biodiesel; Mixture of oil; Optimization; Transesterification,Agricultural wastes; Animals; Catalysts; Methanol; Molar ratio; Oilseeds; Optimization; Regulatory compliance; Surface properties; Synthetic fuels; Analyse of biodiesel; Gray wolves; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Mixture of oil; Molar ratio; Optimisations; Optimizers; Reaction temperature; Response-surface methodology; Transesterifications; Biodiesel; biofuel; catalyst; composite; essential oil; methanol; optimization; response surface methodology,"Vision Group on Science and Technology, VGST: 349","This work was supported by The Vision Group of Science and Technology (VGST) grant funded by The Government of Karnataka, India.

IoT applications utilize both cloud data centers and edge data centers based on the nature of the workload. Due to the stringent latency requirements of IoT applications, the workloads are run on hardware accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs for faster execution. The introduction of such hardware alongside existing variations in the hardware and software configurations of the machines in the data center, increases the heterogeneity of the infrastructure. Optimal job performance necessitates the satisfaction of task placement constraints. This is accomplished through constraint-aware scheduling, where tasks are scheduled on worker nodes with appropriate machine configurations. The presence of placement constraints limits the number of suitable resources available to run a task, leading to queuing delays. As federated schedulers have gained prominence for their speed and scalability, we assess the performance of two such schedulers, Megha and Pigeon, within a constraint-aware context. We extend our previous work on Megha by comparing its performance with a constraint-aware version of the state-of-the-art federated scheduler Pigeon, PigeonC. The results of our experiments with synthetic and real-world cluster traces show that Megha reduces the 99th percentile of job response time delays by a factor of 10 when compared to PigeonC. We also describe enhancements made to Megha’s architecture to improve its scheduling efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.",data centers; federated architecture; job scheduling; placement constraints,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thiyyakat, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: meghanathiyyakat@pesu.pes.edu",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),2624831X,,,,English,IoT.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85180717475,,,,,,,

RIS technique is utilized to minimize the spreading of electromagnetic signals by modifying the surface's electric and magnetic field characteristics. RIS can be adopted with the existing environment to effectively increase efficiency by modifying the radio channel characteristics. The signals are steered to the receiver using an RIS thus improving the link quality. The radio channel is viewed in traditional wireless systems as an uncontrollable entity that typically tampers with transmitted signals. This paper suggests an alternate theoretical model after examining the prevalent models and potential issues. Security of the wireless communication physical layer can be improved with an RIS by just changing the phase of the reflective unit. In this work, the massive Multiple Input Multiple Outputs (MIMO)-based iterative modeling technique is used to build the transmitter, channel, and receiver section. This will simultaneously optimize the RIS passive beamforming pre-coding matrix and thus avoid multi-user interference. At the base station cyclic programming is adopted, it iteratively calculates the active and passive beam-forming RIS matrices. The simulation results demonstrate that the combined pre-coding technique used in this work improves the weighted sum rate, efficiency, and coverage ratio. The results show that MIMO with continuous phase shift RIS achieves a higher Weighted Sum Ratio (WSR) and minimum Channel State Information (CSI) error in comparison with the random phase shift RIS. The performance metrics sum rate, signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), energy efficiency, and transmit power are analyzed and compared. © 2023, Dr D. Pylarinos.

In the present study, using hand layup method, cenosphere-filled areca husk fibre (untreated and alkali-treated) reinforced composites were prepared and experimental investigations were carried to determine crystallinity by X-ray diffraction and chemical composition by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The hardness of the composites was tested by the Shore D hardness test. The thermal properties of the composites were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the thermal conductivity of the specimen was investigated by Lee’s disc method. Among different combinations of composites, 41.3% of crystallinity was found for alkali-treated areca fruit husk fibre reinforced composites through X-ray diffraction. Scanning electrode microscope images have clearly shown the proper bonds between areca fruit husk fibres, cenosphere, and matrix material used, and detailed study is carried out in the present work.

The fluid viscosity is assumed to vary linearly, quadratically and exponentially with temperature. The variable viscosity results in a coupling between stream function and temperature in the Darcy momentum balance equation. The linear instability of the basic state is analyzed numerically by examining small-amplitude disturbances in velocity and temperature fields. By carrying out numerical computations for a wide range of parametric regimes, it is established that the principle of exchange of stabilities (PES) is valid. The critical values of the Darcy-Rayleigh number and of the wave number are obtained. The analysis reveals that the combined influence of variable viscosity and the density-maximum characteristic is to expedite the onset of porous convection much faster compared to their isolation presence. The size of the convection cell decreases with an increase in the Darcy-modified Rayleigh number linked to the quadratic density variant. The outcomes obtained under the limiting cases are shown to exhibit consistency with previously published findings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Density-maximum; Galerkin method; Linear instability; Penetrative convection; Porous medium; Variable viscosity,Porous materials; Viscosity; Density maximum; Fluid viscosity; Linear instabilities; Penetrative convection; Porous medium; Streamfunctions; Temperature variation; Variable viscosity; Viscosity fluids; Viscosity-temperature; Galerkin methods,,"The authors wish to thank the reviewers for their valuable recommendations, which have significantly enriched the quality and depth of this work.",,,,,,,,,,"Shankar, B.M.; Department of Mathematics, India; email: bmshankar@pes.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,7351933,,IHMTD,,English,Int.

Methods: In this study, a 3D finite element model of the skull was created using CT scan data. All complexities of the skull geometry are simulated using ABAQUS software. The model was validated and then, subjected to frontal impact. Energy plots for the same were obtained. Impact analysis was done, and weak areas susceptible to fracture and hence, failure are identified. Results & Discussion: One of the emerging areas of applications of computational bio-mechanics is to understand the behavior of the skull during a traumatic injury, such as head impact during accidents. Finite element study is one such part where significant amount of research is being carried out to understand and predict the craniofacial injuries. For the head and brain trauma analysis, there are many software packages available, including ANSYS, LS-DYNA and ABAQUS. Research is being carried out towards developing high-fidelity human models, especially of the human skull to understand the bio-mechanical behavior when subjected to external impact. Impact analysis done in our study showed that a small change in impact velocity can result in a large change in damage that can happen. Conclusion: The study is expected to complement the existing treatment methodologies. Further, appropriate knowledge of fracture biomechanics can be used to design and develop safety measures in automobiles, sport guards, helmets to prevent and reduce facial injuries. © 2023, The Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons of India.",Craniofacial skeleton; FEM study; Frontal impact; Stress propagation; Virtual Simulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shobha, E.S.; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, India; email: shobha_es@yahoo.com",,Springer,9728279,,,,English,J.

However, this valuable information is scattered in unstructured form within biomedical literature. The structured extraction and qualification of microbe-disease interactions are important. In parallel, recent advancements in deep-learning-based natural language processing algorithms have revolutionized language-related tasks such as ours. This study aims to leverage state-of-the-art deep-learning language models to extract microbe-disease relationships from biomedical literature. Results: In this study, we first evaluate multiple pre-trained large language models within a zero-shot or few-shot learning context. In this setting, the models performed poorly out of the box, emphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning of these language models. Subsequently, we fine-tune multiple language models (specifically, GPT-3, BioGPT, BioMedLM, BERT, BioMegatron, PubMedBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and BioLinkBERT) using labeled training data and evaluate their performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of these fine-tuned models (specifically GPT-3, BioMedLM, and BioLinkBERT), achieving an average F1 score, precision, and recall of over > 0.8 compared to the previous best of 0.74. Conclusion: Overall, this study establishes that pre-trained language models excel as transfer learners when fine-tuned with domain and problem-specific data, enabling them to achieve state-of-the-art results even with limited training data for extracting microbiome-disease interactions from scientific publications. © 2023, The Author(s).",Biomedical informatics; Deep-learning; Fine-tuning; Language models; Microbe-disease relationship extraction; Natural language processing; Transfer learning,Bacteria; Bioinformatics; Computational linguistics; Extraction; Learning systems; Medical informatics; Natural language processing systems; Transfer learning; Zero-shot learning; Biomedical informatics; Deep-learning; Fine tuning; Language model; Language processing; Microbe-disease relationship extraction; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Relationship extraction; Transfer learning; Deep learning; algorithm; health status; human; language; learning; natural language processing; Algorithms; Health Status; Humans; Language; Learning; Natural Language Processing,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N62909-21-1-2032",The study is partly funded by ONR Global Grant—N62909-21-1-2032.,,,,,,,,,,"Palaniappan, S.K.; SBX CorporationJapan; email: sucheendra@sbi.jp",,BioMed Central Ltd,14712105,,BBMIC,37468830,English,BMC Bioinform.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85165375564,,,,,,,

The advancement of RNA-Seq technology has resulted in a large volume of gene expression data for analysis. Results: Our computational model (built on top of TabNet) is first pretrained on an unlabelled dataset of multiple types of adenomas and adenocarcinomas and later fine-tuned on the labelled dataset, showing promising results in the context of the estimation of the vital status of colorectal cancer patients. We achieve a final cross-validated (ROC-AUC) Score of 0.88 by using multiple modalities of data. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that self-supervised learning methods pretrained on a vast corpus of unlabelled data outperform traditional supervised learning methods such as XGBoost, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees that have been prevalent in the tabular domain. The results of this study are further boosted by the inclusion of multiple modalities of data pertaining to the patients in question.

Previous attempts in few states lead to successful identification of enablers and disablers within this systemic context. A Reproductive Health Account was constructed using primary reproductive health expenditure data, collected from a pre-estimated sample size of 519 households spread across 15 villages, using probability proportional to size method, from two selected sub-districts Channapatna and Ramanagara, having mediocre performance indices, within Ramanagara District of Karnataka. Secondary data were extracted from public health websites. Expenditures incurred on six types of health services by respondents of reproductive age group (15–49) during financial year, 2017–2018, within two sub-districts was collected over financial year, 2018–2019. Processed data were then converted to four ‘origin to destination’ matrices each capturing fund movement among two actors, based on accounting principles of National Health Account to develop a contextual Reproductive Health Account. Study included four actors namely financial sources, financial agents, health providers and health activities, all pertaining to reproductive health domain. Matrices helped identify a massive 87.23% burden on households, majorly financed by mortgage bearing astronomical interests and sale of meagre assets. Public sector healthcare at 5.47% was found performing unsatisfactorily. Tertiary level was absorbing disproportional amount of 62.93% funds in conjunction with the laboratory and imaging services. Moreover, pharmaceutical bills at 22.97% caused prolonged distress to these households.

The thermal convection's physics is crucial for optimising the thermofluid system, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing our understanding of natural phenomena. The study examines how the initiation of electrothermal convection in a rotating viscoelastic fluid layer (Walter's B) is influenced by basic temperature gradients and a uniform vertical DC electric field, considering three different types of velocity boundary conditions: free-free, rigid-rigid, and lower rigid and upper free. By applying an electric field to a fluid, studying electrothermal convection helps engineers design effective cooling systems for electronics. The eigenvalue problem is solved by using the Galerkin technique. The Galerkin method is a widely used numerical technique for solving eigenvalue problems. The DC electric field effect exhibits a more stabilising effect for free-free boundaries than rigid and rigid-rigid boundaries. Moreover, the linear temperature profile exhibits a more stabilising effect than the parabolic temperature profile. The control of electrothermal convection on the system with the impact of other physical parameters is also discussed. © 2023, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, the network is vulnerable to a wide range of jamming attacks, which adversely affect its performance. Several countermeasures proposed in the literature require prior knowledge of the communication network and jamming strategy that are computationally intensive. These solutions may not be suitable for many real-world critical applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, a novel self-exploration approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to learn an optimal policy against dynamic attacks in CRN-based IoT applications. This method reduces computational complexity, without prior knowledge of the communication network or jamming strategy. A simulation of the proposed scheme eliminates interference effectively, consumes less power, and has a better Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) than other algorithms. A platform-agnostic and efficient anti-jamming solution is provided to improve CRN's performance when jamming occurs. © 2023 Y.

The in-silico investigations indicated notable binding of 9 c and 9 d against HMGB1(2LY4), while compounds 9 c, 9 h, and 9 g demonstrated high affinity towards HMGB1 Box A (4QR9) proteins. A total of ten compounds, which showed good binding interactions with the target proteins were selected for further synthesis and evaluated for anti-neuroinflammatory activity. The compounds, 9 a–j were synthesized by reacting pyrazole-carbothioamides (iii & iv) with furanyl acetamides (7a–e). FTIR, NMR, and mass spectrometric data confirmed all structures. The in-vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated on microglial cells BV-2, N-9, HMO6, leukemic HAP1 and human fibroblast cells.

The fuels chosen for this study include ethanol-butanol (EB) -gasoline, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) -gasoline and methanol-butanol (MB) -gasoline blends. High density polyethylene (HDPE) is a polymer that is extensively used in several auto parts and fuelling infrastructure materials. Incompatibility between these blends and fueling infrastructure system should be studied comprehensively for the adoption of these alternative fuels to be faster and hassle free. This study intends to gauge the changes in HDPE because of its immersion in the gasoline-alcohol blends mentioned for a period of 4, 30 & 90 days. The changes were ascertained by studying the mass, tensile strength, elongation, and hardness of the samples before and after immersion into blends. Sophisticated techniques were used to characterize the morphological and chemical changes of the polymer. The results showed that there was an increase in the mass of the HDPE samples as a result of the absorption of the blends by the polymeric samples. A decrease in tensile strength and hardness values were recorded for the samples whereas the elongation values were found to increase. Studies revealed that there was neither fuel degradation nor any oxidative degradation of the polymeric sample. The results indicated an increase in the mass and elongation of the HDPE as a result of the absorption of the fuel leads to lesser stable polymeric matrix and decrease in the percentage crystallinity. Hence this investigation led us to the conclusion that all the fuels blends studied are highly compatible with HDPE, even in instances where a change in the mechanical properties is seen, it is similar to that seen in gasoline. © The Author(s) 2023.",acetone; Butanol; degradation; gasoline; high density polyethylene; material compatibility,Acetone; Alternative fuels; Butenes; Crystallinity; Elongation; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Fueling; Hardness; High density polyethylenes; Tensile strength; Acetone butanol ethanols; Auto-parts; Chemical change; Fossil fuel resources; Gasoline blends; High-density polyethylenes; Infrastructure materials; Infrastructure systems; Material compatibility; Morphological changes; Gasoline,,,,,,,,,,,,"HN, M.; Centre for Incubation, India; email: meenaparam75@gmail.com",,SAGE Publications Ltd,952443,,JEPLA,,English,J Elastomers Plast,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165897386,,,,,,,

Hence, accurate detection of the incumbent signal in a given channel, popularly known as spectrum sensing (SS), is essential for CR. Here, in the domain of SS, the authors introduce a new goodness-of-fit test (GoFT) founded on p-norm of the observations at the receiver node. To capture the heavy-tailed nature of noise distribution in practical communication channels, the authors utilise generalised Gaussian distribution (GGD) as a noise model. A novel p-norm detector (PND) and a geometric power detector (GPD) is proposed and corresponding probability density function (PDF) under GGD is derived. Via Monte Carlo simulations, the authors show a match of the derived PDFs with the simulation results. Using Neyman-Pearson framework the performances of PND and GPD are compared with an existing differential entropy detector (DED), the well-known energy detector (ED) and joint correlation and energy detector (CED) under GGD noise model. Evaluation of proposed PND and GPD utilising Monte Carlo simulations indicate a superior performance. Further, the experiments employing real-world data establish superiority of the proposed detectors as compared to existing techniques. The authors derive and implement an optimised threshold for PND, providing further improvement in performance. © 2023 The Authors.

In this work, a prismatic battery with a mini-channel tube design is used to study the characteristics at different discharge rates and flow rates. The characteristics of the battery are stimulated with ANSYS19.2 tool, at discharge rates of 1-C, 1.5-C, and 2-C with water flow rates of 0.05, 0.5, and 5 LPM.

Adults, BCG vaccinated at birth, were sampled longitudinally before and after a second BCG dose. BCG revaccination significantly elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in HLA-DR+CD16−CD14hi monocytes, demonstrating induction of TI. Mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cell interferon (IFN) γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were significantly higher in re-vaccinees and correlated positively with HLA-DR+CD16−CD14hi TI responses. This, however, did not translate into increased mycobacterial growth control, measured by mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA). Post revaccination, elevated secreted TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 to “heterologous” fungal, bacterial, and enhanced CXCL-10 and IFNα to viral stimuli were also observed concomitant with increased anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1RA. RNA sequencing after revaccination highlighted a BCG and LPS induced signature which included upregulated IL17 and TNF pathway genes and downregulated key inflammatory genes: CXCL11, CCL24, HLADRA, CTSS, CTSC. Our data highlight a balanced immune response comprising pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators to be a feature of BCG revaccination-induced immunity. © 2023",Immune response; Immunity; Immunology; Molecular biology; Omics; Transcriptomics,,"BT/COVID0073/02/20; Indian Institute of Science, IISc; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DBT: PR30219/MED/15/189/2018","We thank the volunteers for participating in this study and acknowledge the contributions of clinical research workers at St John's Research Institute.

In addition, more study on chemically reactive activation energy and Cattaneo-Christov heat flux is conducted, and the conclusions from this research are presented. The bioconvection flow of Maxwell nanofluids over a stretched sheet is presented by highly nonlinear partial differential equations, which are reduced to ordinary differential equations using suitable similarity transformations. A shooting method based on the Runge-Kutta technique is used to overcome the issue. The outcomes are graphically represented and explored numerically in detail for the relevant parameters' impact on the velocity, temperature, concentration, and motile microorganisms profiles. Results reveal that the velocity profile is decreased by increasing the magnetic parameter, while those enhanced by the mixed convection parameters. The thermal boundary thickness and temperature profile negatively correlate with the thermal relaxation time and Prandtl number and are proportional to the magnetic parameter. Boosting the Brownian motion parameter, Deborah number, and thermophoresis parameter improves heat transport. The activation energy and Prandtl parameters show an upward trend in concentration profiles. The density of the motile microorganisms is a decreasing function of Lewis and Peclet numbers. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",activation energy; bioconvection; Cattaneo-Christov heat flux; gyrotactic microorganisms; Maxwell nanofluid,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hymavathi, D.; Department of Mathematics, Telangana508254, India; email: dyapahyma@gmail.com",,World Scientific,2179792,,IJPBE,,English,Int.

In the present study, new Schiff base metal complexes of various metals, including ZrO (II), VO(II), Cr (III), Mn (II), Fe (II), Co (II), Ni (II), Cu (II), Zn (II), Cd (II), and Hg (II), were synthesized using microwave radiation.To characterize the synthesized metal complexes, several physical methods were used, including elemental analysis, FT-IR, molar conductance, electronic spectra, 1H-NMR, ESR, magnetic susceptibility, thermal, electrical conductivity, and XRD analysis. Elemental analysis revealed that the complexes were of the 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 (M: L) types. The observed molar conductance values indicated that the complexes were non-electrolytes. The 1H-NMR spectral data suggested that the phenolic protons had been displaced during complexation. Thermo gravimetric analysis showed the presence of water molecules in the coordination metal complexes and confirmed the loss of water molecules in the first step, followed by the decomposition of the ligand in the subsequent step. The synthesized ligand and coordination metal complexes were also studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activity. They were tested against various bacteria and fungi, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella en-teric, klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. The results indicated that some of the metal complexes showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity. Overall, the use of microwave-assisted synthesis in the formation of coordination metal complexes has led to the synthesis of new metal complexes with potential antibacterial and antifungal activity.

The purpose of this research is to use LC-MS analysis to assess the chemotherapeutic efficacy of plant-derived compounds in inhibiting tumorigenesis. The current study is to evaluate the functionally bioactive phytocompounds of Vitex negundo for anticancer activity and execute an in silico molecular docking assessment of V. negundo. HPLC, LC-MS analysis, and DFT studies were used to evaluate bioactive phytocompounds, Casticin, and Luteolin. Further in-silico molecular docking studies of Casticin and Luteolin were performed against breast cancer targets to study the anticancer activities. Subsequently, these phytochemicals were tested for therapeutic activity through the ADMET evaluation using SwissADME and admetSAR prediction tools. ADMET prediction results revealed that Luteolin and Casticin might have the maximum anticancer activity against the various drug target proteins among all the phytochemicals identified in the LC-MS analysis and further, the significant compounds characterized by LC-MS analysis were subjected to molecular docking analysis to orient the ligand-protein interaction and their binding energy. Further, the chemical stability and chemical reactivity of compounds with optimized structures were ascertained with the DFT study.

However, it is still difficult to properly integrate these properties into a single material. In this article, we discussed absorption-based EMI shielding material that serves high absorption and a low reflection purpose. To address this challenge, we fabricated a poly(p-phenylenediamine-co-xylidine) X-band microwave absorbent material. Structural, compositional, thermal, morphological, and microwave absorption/shielding properties of as-synthesized materials were examined using XRD, FTIR, TG-DTA, NMR, UV–vis, FESEM, and VNA. With a filler loading of 8 wt%, poly(p-phenylenediamine-co-xylidine) co-polymer absorber obtained a minimum reflection loss (RLmini) of −37.5 dB with 2.0 mm thickness. The same sample showed shielding effectiveness (SE) of −38 dB Hence, this multipurpose shielding material has practical uses in signal shielding because of its unique high absorbance performance and outstanding shielding effectiveness capabilities. © 2023",Absorption-based EMI shielding; High absorption; Multipurpose; Poly(p-phenylenediamine-co-xylidine),,"King Khalid University, KKU: R.G.P. 2/84/44",Sagr Alamri extends his appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through research groups program under grant number R.G.P. 2/84/44 .,,,,,,,,,,"Hassan, A.; Institute of Physics, Cukrovarnická 10, Czech Republic; email: ah6767@mail.ustc.edu.cn",,Elsevier B.V.,24680230,,,,English,Surf.

Conductivity and dielectric studies at different temperatures were carried out on these BSPE systems by varying the wt% of PEO5 and PVDF with respect to PEO6, keeping the wt% of lithium salt constant. The electrical characterizations of BSPE systems have been investigated using impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range 0.1–106 Hz. The conductivity data shows that inclusion of PEO5 and PVDF into the PEO6 matrix improved the overall lithium-ion dynamics in the polymer matrix.

The internal and external cylinders are considered as isothermal with distinct temperatures and also presumed that the upper and lower sides are adiabatic. The governing equations are solved using the quasi-linearization approach in conjunction with an implicit Crank-Nicolson type FDM to arrive at the non-similar solutions. The results indicate that as the inclination parameter augments the concentration and thermal profiles augments in the annular region. As the reaction rate increases the concentration profile enhances in the annular region, since the concentration boundary layer thickens with higher reaction rate. The temperature gradient of the fluid is significantly affected by an external heat generation parameter, which enhances the fluid temperature distribution and thermal state. The results revealed that a magnetic field can regulate the magnetic convection of conducting fluid. The 3D view of fluid flow in radial and axial direction, temperature and concentration variations for distinct angle of inclinations are also illustrated and discussed explicitly. The FDM data is used to train an ANN model that forecasts the heat and mass transfer characteristics through Levenberg – Marquardt backpropogating algorithm. For various values of significant physical parameters the heat and mass transfer rates has R values as 0.99305 and 0.99991 respectively.

The cloud provides various resources such as virtual machines, computational cores, networks, and other resources for the execution of the various tasks of the internet of things (IoT). Moreover, some methods are used for executing IoT tasks using an optimal resource management system but these methods are not efficient. Hence, in this research, we present a resource-efficient workload task scheduling (RWTS) model for a cloud-assisted IoT environment to execute the IoT task which utilizes few numbers of resources to bring a good tradeoff, achieve high performance using fewer resources of the cloud, compute the number of resources required for the execution of the IoT task such as bandwidth and computational core. Furthermore, this model mainly focuses to reduce energy consumption and also provides a task scheduling model to schedule the IoT tasks in an IoT-cloud-based environment. The experimentation has been done using the Montage workflow and the results have been obtained in terms of execution time, power sum, average power, and energy consumption. When compared with the existing model, the RWTS model performs better when the size of the tasks is increased. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The variation in viscosity causes a dramatic change in the base flow and thereby discards the analytical proof of stability even under the limit of an infinite Prandtl–Darcy number. The question about the stability/instability of the basic flow is thus examined by carrying out a numerical solution of the stability eigenvalue problem for infinite and finite values of the Prandtl–Darcy number.

We show that event-triggered identification requires only a small percentage of data points, resulting in considerably less computational requirement.

The primary unidirectional flow is between two infinite rigid parallel plates, which are either fixed or in relative motion. To investigate the instability of the basic flow, a numerical solution of the resulting eigenvalue problem is performed. Despite the base flow remains to be unaltered, the stability properties differ from those of a Newtonian fluid. In the case of plane Poiseuille flow, two values of the Reynolds number are found to be needed to specify the linear instability criteria owing to the existence of closed neutral stability curves and also the instability emerges only in a certain range of the Kelvin–Voigt parameter Λ . To the contrary, instability occurs for all nonzero values of Λ in the case of plane Couette flow and a single critical value of the Reynolds number is adequate to discuss the stability/instability of fluid flow due to the parabolic nature of the neutral stability curves. The sensitivity of the Kelvin–Voigt parameter is clearly discerned on the stability of both types of flows. The variations of streamlines at the dominant mode of instability are analyzed in comprehending the underlying instability mechanism and shedding light on the secondary flow pattern. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,Aerodynamics; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Flow patterns; Newtonian liquids; Stability criteria; Kelvin-Voigt; Navier Stokes; Neutral stability; Plane Couette flow; Plane Poiseuille flow; Reynold number; Temporal stability; Unidirectional flow; Vis-coelastic fluids; Visco-elastic fluid; Reynolds number,PESUIRF/Math/2020/11,Funding was provided by PES University (Grant No. PESUIRF/Math/2020/11).,,,,,,,,,,"Shankar, B.M.; Department of Mathematics, India; email: bmshankar@pes.edu",,Springer,15970,,AMHCA,,English,Acta Mech,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85162220307,,,,,,,

Crucial information can still be obtained from marginally inexact outputs. Leveraging this, many algorithms such as Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Motion Compensation (MC) use approximate calculations while still maintaining appreciable computation accuracy. When data processing algorithms are taken into consideration, adders play an important role in the arithmetic module by managing the power and area utilization of the system. A fixed-width adder tree design for approximate calculations is proposed, that uses the trade-off between area and accuracy as the base for analysis. Our design uses 12.42%, 18.17% and 5.05% lesser area compared to the full width adder tree, FXAT-PT and FX-AT-DT respectively. Additionally, when compared to FX-AT-DT, TFX-AT and ITFX-AT, the proposed design has an improved Maximum Error Distance (MED) of (33.33%, 29.03%), (63.64%, 65.63%) and (38.46%, 35.29%) for N = 8, 16 respectively. To cope with the inaccuracy caused by truncation, the proposed design employs mux-based radix-4 addition coupled with bias estimation. Further, to examine the error performance we have incorporated the proposed design and a few other existing designs into the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), to process images with different metrics and compare the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images. It was observed that the proposed design showed significant improvement in the PSNR score when compared to ITFX-AT and maintains a score similar to that of FXAT-PT. © 2023, Brazilian Microelectronics Society.

The ability to track on-site activities has always been difficult due to its dynamic and vast nature. Moreover, the traditional and inefficient practices make it a laborious task. The feature of five-dimensional (5D) building information modelling (BIM) is one such tool which can be effectively used to track and monitor the progress of an on-going construction project. The most crucial and dynamic aspects of construction viz., cost and time can be monitored using 5D BIM. However, the need for BIM platform or software to view these 5D simulation files has been the major drawback and the main reason for lack of adaptation. This paper presents a web-based platform, aiming to bring the 5D BIM model and other analytical reports on a single platform which would help all the participants or stakeholders of the project to monitor the aspects of cost and time, and also track the progress of their on-going project through the 5D BIM simulation. The proposed web-based platform, using the simplest tools, provides a potential solution for tracking the progress of the project and making the information accessible to all participants without the need of any BIM platform. © 2023 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ramesh, C.S.; Department of Civil Engineering, RR Nagar Campus, India; email: chinmayiramesh465@gmail.com",Narasimhan M.C.Menon A.Kollerathu J.A.Unnikrishnan S.,American Institute of Physics Inc.,0094243X,,,,English,AIP Conf.

Experts use their unassisted sight to identify diseases throughout vegetation, which is a traditional approach. It is difficult for farmers to seek guidance from the experienced. Manual detection of these illnesses increases human involvement because it is a time-consuming and costly process to inspect every leaf. Plant disease reduces the type and effectiveness of agricultural produce. Early identification of disease and knowledge on crop quality can help reduce diseases using effective management techniques. As a result, seeking for a quick, affordable, and reliable technique to automatically detect illnesses based on symptoms that develop on plant leaves is critical. In this paper a deep learning based methodology which uses Resnet20 and Mobilenet models to identify tomato plant leaf diseases at early stages based on the appearance of the leaf in effort to stop disease spread is proposed.

The performance of models was evaluated across different classifiers using two voice datasets, with different features so as to confirm that FRFE works for any dataset irrespective of features.

However, with the increase in computational abilities, along with the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), turbulence heat transfer characteristics of supercritical fluids can be very accurately predicted. In the present work, heat transfer characteristics for a vertically downward flow of carbon dioxide in a pipe are studied for a wide range of heat flux and mass flux values. Firstly, six different turbulent models available in the commercial CFD software-Ansys Fluent are validated against the experimental results. The k-ω Standard model with enhanced wall treatment is found to be the best-suited turbulence model. When experimental results were validated in CFD, an average error of 1% in the bulk fluid temperature and 2% in the wall temperature were recorded. Further, K-ω Standard Turbulence Model is used in CFD for parametric analysis to generate the data for ANN studies. Mass flux range of 238 to 1038 kg/m2s, and heat flux range of 26 kW/m2 to 250 kW/m2 are used to generate 81,432 data samples. These samples were fed into the ANN program to develop an equation that can predict the heat transfer coefficient. It was found that ANN can predict the heat transfer coefficient for the considered range of values within the absolute average relative deviation of 2.183 %. © (2023), (Yildiz Technical University).

The proposed method involves the usage of a camera lens attached to a Raspberry Pi device to capture live video frames of the user’s environment, which are then transmitted to cloud storage. The link to access these images is stored within a symmetrical private blockchain network (no superior access), where all deep learning servers act as nodes. The deep learning model deployed on these servers analyses the video frames to detect objects and feeds the output back to the cloud service. Ultimately, the user receives audio notifications about obstacles through an earphone plugged into the Raspberry Pi. In particular, when running the model on a high-performing network and an RTX 3090 GPU, the average obstacle notification time is reported within 2 s, highlighting the proposed system’s responsiveness and effectiveness in aiding visually impaired individuals. © 2023 by the authors.",blockchain; cloud storage; deep learning; depth estimation; IoT; object detection; visually impaired,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jadon, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: shrutijadon@pes.edu",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),20738994,,,,English,Symmetry,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85172786710,,,,,,,

The critical values were numerically computed by the Galerkin method for rigid isothermal boundaries. The impact of LTNE and different forms of non-uniform basic temperature gradients on the onset of porous convection was examined. The porosity modified conductivity ratio has no influence on system stability at a small inter-phase heat transport coefficient limit. However, for higher values of the inter-phase heat transport coefficient, an increase in the porosity modified conductivity ratio hastens the onset of convection.

As an excellent alternative fuel additive to biodiesel–diesel blends, higher alcohol exhibits outstanding fuel properties (such as high energy content and cetane number) and can operate in diesel engines without requiring engine changes. This study focuses on investigating the ternary blends comprising higher alcohols, namely 1-heptanol and n-octanol, in hybrid biodiesel (animal fat oil–rice bran oil–cottonseed oil) and diesel on compression ignition engine characteristics. The performance, combustion, and emissions of a diesel engine fuelled with mono (D100), binary (B20), and ternary fuel blends (B20H10, B20H20, B20O10, and B20O20) were analysed at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. The test fuels met the American Society for Testing and Materials standards for fuel properties and exhibited stable behaviour during testing. Experimental results showed that at 100% load, the least brake-specific fuel consumptions for diesel fuel, B20, B20H10, B20H20, B20O10, and B20O20 were 254.1 g/kWh, 302.14 g/kWh, 281.25 g/kWh, 310.94 g/kWh, 292.8 g/kWh, and 313.80 g/kWh, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum brake thermal efficiency values were obtained as 38.65%, 37.01%, 37.76%, 36.84%, 37.12%, and 36.38%, respectively. At 100% load, the peak heat release rates for diesel, B20, B20H10, B20H20, B20O10, and B20O20 were found to be 64.65 J/deg, 59.07 J/deg, 62.34 J/deg, 56.12 J/deg, 57.95 J/deg, and 51.9 J/deg, respectively. The addition of 1-heptanol and n-octanol as oxygenated additives into the ternary blend resulted in decreased carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions while increasing carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions compared to diesel fuel. Overall, the study concludes that ternary blends with 1-heptanol and n-octanol as additives improve performance and combustion behaviour and reduce exhaust emissions compared to binary blends. © 2023 by the authors.",1-heptanol; biodiesel; emissions; engine combustion; n-octanol; ternary blends,Brakes; Cotton; Cottonseed oil; Diesel engines; Fuel additives; Ignition; Oilseeds; Petroleum additives; Proven reserves; Thermal efficiency; 1-heptanol; Compression ignition engine; Emission; Engine combustion; Experimental investigations; Fuel properties; Higher alcohols; Ignition engine combustion; N-octanol; Ternary blends; Biodiesel,"Vision Group on Science and Technology, VGST: 349","This work was supported by The Vision Group of Science and Technology (VGST) grant funded by The Government of Karnataka, India.

The spread of new viral variants leading to epidemic and pandemic infection can be effectively contained, if broad-spectrum vaccines effective against the newer viral variants are readily available. The development of broad-spectrum, pan-neutralising antibodies against viruses which, in general terms, are very antigenically different — such as HIV, influenza virus and paramyxoviruses — has been reported in the literature. The amino acid sequences used to generate a range of approved recombinant anti-viral vaccines were analysed by using in silico methods, with the aim of identifying highly antigenic peptide regions that may be suitable for the development of broad-spectrum peptide-based anti-viral vaccines. This was achieved through the use of open-source data, an algorithm-driven probability matrix, and published in silico prediction tools (SVMTriP, IEDB-AR, VaxiJen 2.0, AllergenFP v. 1.0, AllerTOP v. 2.0, ToxinPred and ProtParam) to evaluate antigenicity, MHC-I and MHC-II binding potential, immunogenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and physicochemical properties. We report a pan-antigenic peptide region with strong affinity for MHC-I and MHC-II, and good immunogenic potential. According to the output from the relevant in silico tools, the peptide was predicted to be non-toxic, non-allergic and to possess the desired physicochemical properties for potentially successful vaccine production. With further investigation and optimisation, this peptide could be considered for use in the development of a broad-spectrum anti-viral vaccine that may protect against emerging new viruses. Our approach of using in silico methods to identify candidate antigenic peptides with the desired physicochemical properties could potentially circumvent the use of some animal studies for peptide vaccine candidate evaluation. © The Author(s) 2023.",antigenicity; immunogenicity; in silico; peptide antibodies; probability matrix; vaccine; viruses,hepatitis A hepatitis B vaccine; HLA antigen; Human papilloma virus vaccine; ibacovavec; influenza vaccine; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; membrane antigen; nvx-cov2373 vaccine; peptide vaccine; prehevbrio; recombinant hepatitis B vaccine; recombinant vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; sputnik v; sputnik v vaccine; tozinameran; varicella zoster vaccine; vaxzevria; virus vaccine; amino acid sequence; Article; artificial neural network; computer model; coronavirus disease 2019; drug antigenicity; drug design; drug toxicity; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; herpes virus infection; influenza; major histocompatibility complex; papillomavirus infection; physical chemistry; prediction; protein analysis; vaccine immunogenicity,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chatterjee, J.; Department of Biotechnology, India; email: jhinukchatterjee@pes.edu",,SAGE Publications Inc.,2611929,,AALAD,37548284,English,Altern.

The current work aims at the synthesis of copper ferrite nano catalyst by microwave assisted solution incineration approach. The catalytic properties stood verified by X-ray diffraction, SEM, EDAX and BET techniques. The catalytic performance of the copper ferrite catalyst were reinforced through in-situ microwave assisted acetalization reaction of furfural with discrete solvents like methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol at optimum reaction conditions for the preparation of wide range of commodity chemicals such as carboxylic acids, alkyl esters, di alkyl acetals, di ketones which are of commercial importance.

Generally, the performance of heat exchangers is analyzed adopting constant properties for the working fluid. But, in cryogenic heat exchangers, fluids reach their critical states with significant variations in their properties. The current work is based on the effect of fluid property variations in the performance analysis of a two-fluid countercurrent cryogenic heat exchanger subject to ambient heat in a leak. Finite element method–subdomain method is used to conduct the performance analysis. The effect of fluid property variations is analyzed considering effectiveness, ∈, as the performance parameter. The percentage deviation in the effectiveness value on considering fluid property variation is determined. The relationship between effectiveness ∈ and the number of transfer units (NTUs) is obtained by plotting the ∈-NTU curve by varying the mass flow rate of the fluid flow.

In this paper, four arrangements of three-fluid cross-flow heat exchanger (3FCFHX) with different flow conditions are considered as shown in Figure 1 in which is the performance of cross-countercurrent and cross-cocurrent arrangements for uniform and flow maldistribution at the inlet. In addition, the effect of different inlet fluid flow models on the HX performance are investigated numerically. Among the three fluids in these arrangements, the central fluid is considered to be the hot fluid. From the principles of conservation of energy, the governing equations for three fluids are generated and solved using the finite element method. Four different inlet fluid-flow models are considered for the analysis. Performance is judged using hot fluid effectiveness and the number of transfer units for a different range of governing parameters. The effects of inlet flow maldistribution (IFM) are measured using degradation factors. The results show that the performance of cross-cocurrent arrangement is found to be superior to the cross-countercurrent arrangement. In addition, the IFM enhances thermal performance. Further, it is determined that the flow maldistribution at the inlet will enhance the hot fluid effectiveness by 4%–4.5% and 1.8%–2% in cross-cocurrent and countercurrent arrangements, respectively. The results give a thorough insight into the significant concerns involved in the design of such HXs. Application of the finite element method proves the ease of determining the exit temperatures of the fluids in the HX. This approach is indeed time-saving and gives insights when compared to the CFD approach. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",cross-flow HX; flow maldistribution; nonuniformity; three-fluid,Computational fluid dynamics; Flow of fluids; Heat exchangers; Co currents; Counter current; Cross flows; Cross-flow HX; Flow maldistribution; Hot fluids; Nonuniformity; Thermal Performance; Three-fluid; Finite element method,,,,,,,,,,,,"K.

Conducting polymers (CPs) are more promising materials than other polymers due to their diverse electronic applications, including electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, light-emitting diodes, energy storage devices, and the most sophisticated forms of sensors. In this study, the effect of nanoclay on the electrical conductivity, humidity, and EMI shielding properties of silver-decorated polyaniline and its nanocomposites has been investigated. Silver-decorated polyaniline was prepared by using an in situ polymerization technique at 0-5 °C in the presence of ammonium persulphate, which acts as an oxidizing agent. Varied weight% amounts of nano clay were mixed in the conducting silver-decorated polyaniline to obtain their nanocomposite. The synthesized silver-decorated polyaniline and its composites were characterized by using several physical methods, viz., Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All these spectral data reveal the structural characteristics, morphology, and uniform distribution of silver and nano clay particles in the conducting polymer composites. The AC electrical conductivity data show that increasing the nanocrystal weight percentage increases its electrical conductivity. The electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of silver-decorated polyaniline nano clay composites shows 90% attenuation between −5 and −8.5 dB. Humidity sensitivity showed a linear relationship with increasing nano clay weight in the decorated polyaniline due to the porosity of the nanoclays and specific adsorption of moisture content. Hence, these composites can be used as a promising material for humid sensors, EMI shielding, battery capacitors, and other technological applications. © 2023 RSC.",,,"PESUIRF/Chemistry-ECC/2020/14; Durban University of Technology, DUT","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the management of PES University, Electronic City Campus, Bangalore, and the Vision Group on Science and Technology for their support in carrying out this research work, under the grant PESUIRF/Chemistry-ECC/2020/14 dated 30-09-2020.

Given the effectiveness of machine learning models in simulating such complex nonlinear phenomena, the authors opted to employ them in the modelling of the life cycle of tea pests, which impact several other crops as well. Accordingly, multiple machine learning models were developed to forecast the occurrence of tea pest looper infestations. They utilized data for just two readily available parameters-temperature and rainfall-to investigate whether predictive models of good quality can be created even with limited data, particularly for small tea growers. After analyzing the various models generated, they discovered that neural network models can produce accurate predictions even with a restricted data set. Therefore, they are optimistic that new age technologies such as machine learning can benefit many small farmers in India who lack access to various technologies and, as a result, have limited data. © 2023, IGI Global.

Constant amplitude tensile fatigue test is conducted for 80%, 70%, and 60% of the ultimate load of respective composites at a stress ratio of 0.1 and frequency of 7 Hz for both laminates. The jute-wool felt composite showed good fatigue resistance. Though glass fiber composite showed higher tensile strength, jute-wool felt composite exhibits higher fatigue performance than glass fiber composites at higher stress levels. However, at lower stress levels, glass fiber composite shows better fatigue resistance than jute-wool felt composite. A prediction model that uses a few set of experimental results of fatigue test was able to validate the fatigue behavior of composites.

The main objective of the study was to explore the optimizations of variable feed per tooth (fz), cutting speed (Vc), and depth of cut (ap) parameters on the key outcomes of the micro-milling process. A unique experimental setup was employed, employing a spindle capable of achieving up to 60,000 revolutions per minute. Additionally, the study leveraged linear slides backed by micro-step motors to facilitate precise axis movements, thereby maintaining a resolution accuracy of 0.1 μm. Cutting forces were accurately captured by a mini dynamometer and subsequently evaluated based on the peak to valley values for Fx (tangential force) and Fy (feed force). The study results revealed a clear and complex interplay between the varied cutting parameters and their subsequent impacts on the cutting forces and surface roughness. An increase in feed rate and depth of cut significantly increased the cutting forces. However, the cutting forces were found to decrease noticeably with the elevation of cutting speed. Intriguingly, the tangential force (Fx) was consistently higher than the feed force (Fy). Simultaneously, the study determined that the surface roughness, denoted by Sa values, increased in direct proportion to the feed rate. It was also found that the Sa surface roughness values decreased with the increase in cutting speed. This study recommends a parameter combination of fz = 5 µm/tooth feed rate, Vc = 62.8 m/min cutting speed, and ap = 400 µm depth of cut to maintain a Sa surface roughness value of less than 1 µm while ensuring an optimal material removal rate and machining time.

SKAO data products made available to astronomers will be correspondingly large and complex, requiring the application of advanced analysis techniques to extract key science findings. To this end, SKAO is conducting a series of Science Data Challenges, each designed to familiarize the scientific community with SKAO data and to drive the development of new analysis techniques. We present the results from Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2), which invited participants to find and characterize 233 245 neutral hydrogen (H i) sources in a simulated data product representing a 2000 h SKA-Mid spectral line observation from redshifts 0.25-0.5. Through the generous support of eight international supercomputing facilities, participants were able to undertake the Challenge using dedicated computational resources. Alongside the main challenge, 'reproducibility awards' were made in recognition of those pipelines which demonstrated Open Science best practice. The Challenge saw over 100 participants develop a range of new and existing techniques, with results that highlight the strengths of multidisciplinary and collaborative effort. The winning strategy - which combined predictions from two independent machine learning techniques to yield a 20 per cent improvement in overall performance - underscores one of the main Challenge outcomes: that of method complementarity. It is likely that the combination of methods in a so-called ensemble approach will be key to exploiting very large astronomical data sets. © 2023 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.",galaxies: statistics; methods: data analysis; radio lines: galaxies; software: simulations; surveys; techniques: imaging spectroscopy,Distributed computer systems; Galaxies; Learning systems; Analysis techniques; Data challenges; Data products; Galaxies: statistics; Methods.

WSe2 monolayer sample showed better absorption capabilities as compared to LaCoO3 single-layer sample. The microwave absorption effectiveness of bilayer absorbents was scrutinized using a simulation approach. The simulation results demonstrated that a bilayer absorber composed of LaCoO3 as the bottom layer (0.5 mm thickness) and WSe2 on the top layer (1.5 mm thickness) can obtain a minimum reflection loss (RLmini) of −42.5 dB with an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 2.8 GHz (12.4 GHz–9.6 GHz) at 10.8 GHz. Simulation predictions and experimental findings were juxtaposed; which accord with one another quite well. The findings demonstrate that the exceptional microwave absorption performance of the bilayer absorber may be attributed to its layered architecture.

Scholarly independence (SI) is a unique indicator that can be used to understand and assess the research performances of individual scholars. The SI is a rare quality that most funding agencies and universities seek during funding decisions or hiring processes. We propose author lineage independent score (ALIS), a unique model to measure SI of a scholar by using his or her academic genealogy tree as the underlying graph structure. The analysis is performed on real data of 100 authors, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) and the Mathematics Genealogy Project. The analysis is further validated on a larger scale, on a simulated sample of 10,000 authors. The simulation exercise is the proof-of-concept for scalability of the metric and the proposed optimisation model. ALIS exploits genealogical relationships between scholars and their mentors and collaborating communities and constructs an influence scoring model based on the Genealogy tree structure of the respective scholars. The implications from the theoretical model are found to be profound in tracing known and recursive citation patterns among peers. The genealogy tree is used to investigate the advisor–advisee relationship and lays the foundation for defining metrics used to calculate the various indicators such as non-genealogy citations (NGCs), non-community citations (NCCs) and other citation quotient (OCQ). As these indicators/parameters are novel and thus not readily accessible, algorithms are written to compute these indicator values for the scholars under study. © The Author(s) 2021.",Author lineage independent score (ALIS); bibliometrics; genealogy tree; non-community citation; research evaluation; scholarly independence,Forestry; History; Author lineage independent score; Bibliometric; Decision process; Funding agencies; Fundings; Genealogy tree; Non-community citation; Research evaluation; Research performance; Scholarly independence; Trees (mathematics),,,,,,,,,,,,"Dey, S.R.; PES UniversityIndia; email: Sudeepar@gmail.com",,SAGE Publications Ltd,1655515,,JISCD,,English,J Inf Sci,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118943933,,,,,,,

The repeating idea of placing a tax on the production, use, and emission of carbon by industry has been recognized and implemented by governments worldwide. The principle addressed in this chapter advocates for the implementation of carbon tax measures in a selective and authoritative manner, which historically led to non-conformity, restlessness, and inefficiency.

Natural-fiber-reinforced polymer composites offer distinct advantages such as biodegradability, eco-friendliness, flexibility, low density, and higher specific strengths, etc. This study focuses on natural-fiber (hemp and banana)-fabric-reinforced polymer composites suitable for exterior-engineered parts. The hand lay-up process is used to fabricate these hybrid composites. Exterior-engineered products are highly susceptible to moisture, which can deteriorate their mechanical performances, including their tensile and flexural strength, thereby affecting the durability of the hybrid composites. Therefore, the hybrid composites are subjected to water absorption tests, where samples are immersed in distilled water for week-long intervals. After each interval, the water-absorbed specimens are tested for their tensile and flexural characteristics as per ASTM D-3039 and ASTM D-790, respectively. The moisture treatment had a notable impact on the composite materials, causing a slight decrease in the tensile strength by 2% due to the diminished lateral strength in the interlaminar fibers. Contrary to expectations, the flexural strength of the composites improved by 2.7% after the moisture treatment, highlighting the potential of the moisture treatment process to enhance the elastic properties of such composites. The dimensions of the specimens changed after the water immersion test, resulting in increased longitudinal and decreased lateral dimensions. The surface morphologies of the composite failure samples showed fiber delamination, fiber breakage, voids, and matrix fractures. © 2023 by the authors.",fiber-reinforced hybrid composites; hemp and banana fibers; mechanical characterization; moisture absorption; SEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lakshmikanthan, A.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: avinash.l@nmit.ac.in

The flow is governed by modified Darcy's law with two different forms of viscosity-temperature relationships namely, quadratic and exponential. The modal analysis is carried out with a velocity-temperature formulation of the governing equations for the perturbations. The temperature-dependence of the viscosity forbids the energy analysis of Gill [“A proof that convection in a porous vertical slab is stable,” J. Fluid Mech. 35, 545-547 (1969)] in embarking upon any definite conclusion on the stability of fluid flow even under the limit of an infinite Prandtl-Darcy number, and consequently, the stability eigenvalue problem is solved numerically. Types of temperature-dependent viscosity laws are found to demonstrate conflicting behavior on the stability characteristics of the base flow. The results show that the base flow is linearly stable if the viscosity varies with temperature quadratically. On the contrary, instability emerges for an exponential type of variation in viscosity beyond a certain range of values of the corresponding viscosity parameter depending on the Prandtl-Darcy number. It is established that an increase in the value of the viscosity parameter is to decrease the critical Darcy-Rayleigh number markedly and thereby destabilizes the fluid flow. © 2023 Author(s).",,Aerodynamics; Buoyancy; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Flow of fluids; Modal analysis; Temperature distribution; Viscosity; Baseflows; Buoyant flow; Darcy number; Fluid viscosity; Isothermal boundaries; Porous slab; Variable viscosity; Vertical porous layers; Viscosity fluids; Viscosity parameters; Stability,,The comments and suggestions from three anonymous reviewers are very much appreciated.,,,,,,,,,,"Shankar, B.M.; Department of Mathematics, India; email: bmshankar@pes.edu",,American Institute of Physics Inc.,10706631,,PHFLE,,English,Phys.

The production of Metal Matrix Composite (MMCs) with varying wt. % of reinforcement/s leads to enhancement of wear and mechanical behavior properties. In the present work, varying wt. % of TiB2 and constant wt. % of CeO2 particulates were reinforced in Al6061 alloy to manufacture hybrid Al MMCs by Vortex (Stircasting) technique. Developed hybrid MMCs were hotrolled at 515°C of temperature. Hardness of hybrid MMCs was evaluated by using hardness test rig (Vickers). Results revealed that the hardness strength of developed hybrid MMCs increased with increase of the reinforcement content. The rate of wear of developed hybrid MMCs was evaluated by Pin-on-Disc wear test method. Test trials were conducted according to Taguchi technique. L27 array was implemented for evaluation of data. Effect of varying factors on the rate of wear and Coefficient of Friction (COF) was analyzed by applying ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) method. ANOVA outcomes showed that the reinforcement content had a more significant impact on wear behavior and COF of the MMCs. Finally, L27 array outcomes were verified through confirmation experiments.

Recognition of stress is one of the facets in developing the Mental Healthcare (MHC) system framework. With the advent of technology, smart wearable devices have paved a way to collect data in real-time to provide the cutting-edge reports about the individual. Due to the physiological sensors present in the smart wearable devices, it is now possible to have a robust system to recognize the stress of the smart wearable devices user thus consecutively leading to recognition of factors in leading to stress. However, the current MHC system for recognition and identification of stress have several drawbacks. First, stress recognition is mostly designed for a particular group of individuals like occupational stress, perinatal maternal stress, or health worker stress and fails to propose a framework that would not be targeted for a particular group of individual. Second, most of the previous work done on stress recognition focuses on the extraction of handcrafted features thus requiring human intervention and expertise. To address these issues, this study proposes, a hybrid deep learning based ensemble approach for automated extraction of features and classification into various state of stress for MHC system. The proposed framework takes input from wearable physiological sensors and is provided to deep learning classifier of convolutional neural network (CNN) and CNN-long short term memory based ensemble model. The proposed framework has been experimented on the wearable stress and affect detection dataset and reports an accuracy of 91.52% that is 7.20% higher than earlier reported accuracies from other machine learning and deep learning models. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CNN; CNN LSTM; ensemble deep learning model; Mental Healthcare system; stress recognition; WESAD dataset,Convolutional neural networks; Health care; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Physiological models; Physiology; Wearable sensors; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network LSTM; Ensemble deep learning model; Learning models; Mental healthcare systems; Smart wearables; Stress recognition; Wearable devices; WESAD dataset; Extraction,,,,,,,,,,,,"Singh, G.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Haryana, India; email: ghanapriya@nitkkr.ac.in",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,2664720,,EXSYE,,English,Expert Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147995036,,,,,,,

According to Harvard University research, medical errors cause nearly 5,000,000 deaths in India annually. The third most common cause of mortality, medical error is one of the top 10 killers. In the neonatal ICU, there are 0.7 medical errors per patient, compared to 1.5 errors per child in a pediatric emergency room. The prevalence of HF appears to be high in India, with estimates ranging from 1.3 million to 4.6 million, and an annual incidence of 491 600-1.8 million. Heart failure is a clinical illness that develops as the cardiac condition deteriorates. The prognosis and course of therapy for HF patients depend heavily on early diagnosis. Low staff-to-patient ratios, a lack of established standard medical protocol, and infrequent monitoring and evaluation of patient safety and quality indicators are the main causes of medical errors. Since human error is the main cause of medical errors, the appropriate technology may be used to reduce them. The goal of this project is to make use of the Federated Learning approach in health care to solve the problem of clinical deterioration and ultimately save lives. © 2023 ACM.",datasets; gaze detection; neural networks; text tagging,Anomaly detection; Deterioration; Diagnosis; Errors; Long short-term memory; Patient treatment; Anomaly detection; Critical care units; Critically-ill patients; Dataset; Gaze detection; Medical errors; Neural-networks; Real time streaming; Streaming data; Text tagging; Intensive care units,,,,,,,,,,,,"Srinivas, K.S.; Pes UniversityIndia; email: srinivasks@pes.edu",,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.7984E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of these patients can be used to extract and analyze quantifiable features with potential clinical significance. We hypothesize that there is a correlation between radiomic features extracted from MRI scans and survival. Along with clinical data, the radiomic features could be used in survival prediction of patients, providing beneficial information for clinicians to design personalized treatment plans. Methods In our study, we have utilized 3D Slicer for tumor segmentation and feature extraction and performed survival prediction of patients with glioma using four different machine learning models. Results and Conclusion Among the models compared, we have achieved a maximum prediction accuracy of 64.4% using the k-nearest neighbors model, which was trained and tested on a combination of clinical data and radiomic features extracted from MRI images provided in the BraTS 2020 dataset. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

These advances have enabled the creation of autonomous vehicles that can navigate roads and make driving decisions without the need for human intervention. However, the use of sensors and cameras in these vehicles has raised concerns about privacy, as they capture a vast amount of data, including location-specific landmarks and personally identifiable information. The identification and obfuscation of such sensitive data during preprocessing can be a costly process. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a Swarm Learning-based training approach for autonomous driving systems. Swarm Learning involves sharing model learnings across nodes rather than raw data, which can help to protect privacy. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, this approach offers performance that is comparable to traditional training methods. It also exhibits improvements over other distributed machine learning techniques such as Federated Learning. Overall, the Swarm Learning approach presents a promising solution for the development of autonomous driving systems that maintain high performance while addressing privacy concerns. By sharing model learnings rather than raw data, Swarm Learning helps to protect sensitive information and reduces the risk of privacy breaches. This approach offers a viable alternative to traditional training methods, enabling the creation of autonomous driving systems that are both effective and respectful of privacy. © 2023 ACM.",Autonomous Driving; Decentralized training; Federated Learning; Privacy Preserving; Swarm Learning,Autonomous vehicles; Deep learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Autonomous driving; Decentralised; Decentralized training; Driving systems; Federated learning; Model learning; Performance; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Swarm learning; Learning systems,Robert Bosch,"This work is partly supported by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for providing the swarm learning framework.

This article focuses on 23 key linguistic features (15 extracted and 08 derived) for successful detection of Hindi fake news. These features are grouped as lexical, semantic, syntactic, psycho-linguistic, readability, and quantity features. The contribution is twofold. In the first phase, the dataset is preprocessed and linguistic features are extracted. In the second phase, feature sets are generated as word embeddings, and an Ensemble voting classification is carried out on the feature sets.

Linear and parabolic variation of wall temperatures are considered for the present investigation. Computations are made for two pressures of 225 Bar and 235 Bar, for wide range of temperature difference from 4K to 20K. The values of temperature difference are chosen. Based on the results obtained, correlations have been proposed to evaluate the Nusselt numbers for both free and mixed convection with pressure ratios of P/Pc = 1.02 (p = 225 bar) and P/Pc = 1.065 (p = 235 bar). The correlations cover a range of Rayleigh numbers, Rax from 106 to 109 for Free Convection and grashoff Number/Reynolds Number2 ranging from 0.4 to 8 for Mixed convection. The proposed correlations for local Nusselt numbers do not exceed maximum deviation of 15% from the predicted values. It has been found that the maximum deviation occurs for those cases for which the pseudo-critical temperature, T* is within the boundary layer. It is further observed that for these cases both the velocity and temperature profiles are distorted at locations where the temperature is close to the pseudo-critical temperature thereby affecting the gradients at the wall, which in turn influences the heat transfer coefficient. © 2023, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Traveler’s dilemma is an entirely new type of game in comparison to Prisoner’s dilemma because of the role of backward induction chain. The game presents a unique challenge as we strive to reduce this classical game to a quantum game without compromising its integrity and complexity. In classical TD with a strict game-theoretical approach, backward induction causes descent to a Nash equilibrium with the worst payoff. Interestingly, experiments have shown that individuals and groups choose strategies that demonstrably provide much higher payoffs than what the pure classical analysis predicts. We have shown in this paper that with the quantum model, the payoffs are Pareto-optimal at the Nash equilibrium with maximally entangled particles. As the entanglement is made non-maximal, it is observed that the quantum strategies do not always produce the Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium at all values of the entanglement parameter γ . We observe phase transition like behavior for the Nash equilibria. The behavior of the TD game with a generalized payoff matrix and the effect of the entanglement parameter are analyzed in detail in this work. The relation between the Eisert–Wilkens–Lewenstein entangler parameter γ and the von Neumann entropy S of the resultant state is analyzed. As can be anticipated in an actual experiment, entanglement may not always be maximal and therefore it becomes important to know the value of the parameter γ before the players finalize a strategy. We show that the Traveler’s dilemma is completely resolved in the quantum model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",EWL protocol; Quantum entanglement; Traveler’s dilemma,Computation theory; Game theory; Pareto principle; Backward induction; Entanglement parameters; EWL protocol; Nash equilibria; Pareto-optimal; Quantum analog; Quantum games; Quantum models; Theoretical approach; Traveler’s dilemma; Quantum entanglement,,One of the authors Hoor Banu thanks PES University for the fellowship for the PhD course.,,,,,,,,,,"Rao, K.R.; Department of Physics, India; email: raghavendrarao@pes.edu",,Springer,15700755,,,,English,Quantum Inf.

The momentum transfer is modeled by adopting Darcy’s law including time-dependent velocity term contribution. The conduction stream function and temperature fields are significantly altered due to internal heating, and the linear instability is analyzed through a study of normal mode perturbations on the base flow. The neutral stability curves and the critical Darcy–Rayleigh number for the onset of instability are evaluated by solving the stability eigenvalue problem numerically. It has been established that a uniform volumetric heat source and the Prandtl–Darcy number reinforce together in initiating the instability of the base flow under certain conditions despite their isolation presence evidences stability for all infinitesimal perturbations.

Siamese convolutional networks (SCN) have recently been used to detect changes. However, these approaches are unable to eliminate drawbacks such as coarse borders and empty holes because of the lack of spatial and other necessary information. So, the main goal of this paper is to develop a network that captures necessary features and has a better feature fusion technique for detecting changes. This is achieved by the proposed Siamese Capsule Multi-level Attention-based CD Network (SCMACDnet). Initially, the Siamese Capsule Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDnet) is introduced to extract spatial features effectively using capsule attention block (CAB). Afterward, Change Atrous Feature Fusion (CAFF) is introduced to hierarchically combine them by exploring the fusion of channel pairs at several feature levels. Also, multi-scale data from the feature map (FM) is captured with a quicker inference speed using Stride Atrous Convolutional Pooling (SACP) in CAFF. Finally, an effective Reverse Dual Attention (RDA) module is introduced to highlight the changed areas by considering both the channel and pixel-wise correlation (PC) to preserve the shape and edges of the changed areas. Experiments conducted on the CDnet 2014 dataset demonstrate that the SCMACDnet method outperforms other existing methods in terms of precision (.963), sensitivity (.960), the F1 measure (.95), and the Percentage of Wrong Classification (.212). Further, the ablation study validates the efficiency of the proposed SCEDnet, CAFF, and RDA. The results show that the proposed SCMACDnet successfully identifies changes with accurate boundaries and shapes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",CapsNet; Change detection; Multi-level fusion; Siamese convolutional networks,Classification (of information); Convolution; Capsnet; Change detection; Convolutional networks; Encoder-decoder; Features fusions; Image-analysis; Multi level fusion; Multilevels; Siamese convolutional network; Video analysis; Change detection,,,,,,,,,,,,"Venugopal, N.; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karnataka, India; email: venugopaln@pes.edu",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,9424962,,MUSYE,,English,Multimedia Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148889320,,,,,,,

The asymmetric unit comprises six independent molecules (Z′ = 6), all of which are planar. The r.m.s. deviations from each mean plane range from 0.0063 to 0.0381 14;Å, not including the CF3fluorine atoms. Within the crystal, two of the molecules form hydrogen-bonded dimers that in turn combine with inversion-related copies to form tetrameric constructs. Similar tetramers, but lacking inversion symmetry, are formed by the remaining four molecules. The tetramers are linked into tape-like motifs by S⋯O and O⋯O close contacts. The environments of each symmetry-independent molecule were compared via a Hirshfeld surface analysis. The most abundant atom-atom contacts are between fluorine atoms, while the strongest result from N - H⋯O hydrogen bonds. © 2023 International Union of Crystallography.

The root cause lies in the complex multi-contextual nature of the problem. The way a disinformation propagates on the social graph depends on multiple contexts i.e., content of the original news, credibility of the news source, poster of the message referring the news, message content, recipients of message with their social as well as psychological backgrounds, the role played by the available knowledge, and the temporal as well as the propagation pattern while the message becomes viral on the social graph. This article reviews each of these contexts to define the multi-contextual learning problem and summarizes the work done using each of them. Multi-contextual learning gets exacerbated by few other challenges. This article also reviews the approaches adopted so far to tackle each of these challenges along with an exhaustive review of the multi-contextual learning strategies adopted so far. The multi-contextuality aspect as well as the related challenges are horizontal in nature across the three primary verticals of disinformation i.e., fake news, rumor, and propaganda. Existing review articles primarily tackle one of these verticals in isolation with one or few of the above mentioned contexts. Also the related challenges have not seen any focused review so far.

The viscoelastic behavior is modelled by means of a constitutive equation encompassing the Navier-Stokes-Voigt fluid or the Kelvin-Voigt fluid of order zero. The onset of convective instability is examined by linearizing the governing equations for the perturbations and an appropriate extension of Squire's theorem is given making a case to consider only two-dimensional perturbation stability equations. The numerical solution of the stability eigenvalue problem leads to the determination of the neutral stability condition. The dependence of the Kelvin-Voigt parameter on the critical stability parameters and also on the Prandtl number at which the point of transition from stationary to travelling-wave mode occurs is thoroughly analysed. The Kelvin-Voigt parameter shows an important role on the travelling-wave mode instability where it inducts both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on the base flow depending on the values of Prandtl number, while its impact on the stationary mode is found to be very weak. Furthermore, the streamlines and isotherms of the perturbation modes presented herein demonstrate the development of complex dynamics at the critical state. The results of a Newtonian fluid are obtained as a particular case. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Natural convection; Navier-Stokes-Voigt fluid; Normal modes; Stability analysis; Vertical layer,Critical current density (superconductivity); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Isotherms; Natural convection; Navier Stokes equations; Newtonian liquids; Stability; Viscoelasticity; Kelvin-Voigt; Navi-stoke-voigt fluid; Navier Stokes; Normal modes; Side walls; Stability analyze; Traveling wave mode; Vertical layer; Vis-coelastic fluids; Visco-elastic fluid; Prandtl number,,"We are indebted to two anonymous and very observant referees for trenchant remarks on the previous manuscript.

These systems have led to vast research and have attracted commercial interest. However, the existing techniques are image-based systems limited to using an in-shop target clothing from a pre-defined dataset. To address this, we propose a video-based virtual try-on network DPV-VTON, that simulates the try-on using the target cloth extracted from the fashion videos on a target person image, while preserving the details and the characteristics. The core of the DPV-VTON pipeline is made up of (i) Best Frame Selection (BFS) module that extracts the best frame from the video (ii) Clothing Extraction module (CEM) extracts the target clothing from the selected best frame and generates a binary mask. (iii) A virtual try-on module synthesizes a final virtual try-on. Experiments on the existing benchmark datasets and a curated video dataset demonstrate that DPV-VTON generates photo-realistic and visually promising results. The proposed model obtains the lowest FID, LPIPS and the highest SSIM scores compared to the existing systems. © 2023 ACM.",best frame; cloth extraction; Fashion videos; VTON; warped clothes,Image processing; Virtual addresses; Best frame; Binary masks; Cloth extraction; Detail preserving; Fashion video; Frame selection; Image based system; Virtual try-on; VTON; Warped clothes; Extraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

The difficulty can be attributed to the synthetic methods, precursor materials, and surfactants used for surface modification. To provide a better understanding of the role of surfactants in materials synthesis, properties, and applications, this work reports the effect of surface modifiers using three different surfactants: cationic (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, CTAB), anionic (sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS), and non-ionic (Tween 80, T80). The effect of these surfactants on the catalytic properties and the degradation efficiency of the polymeric matrix (CuO/PVA) has been investigated using 1,3,7-Trimethylpurine-2,6-dione (caffeine) as a major pollutant. From the kinetics studies, R2 = 0.9939 for Freundlich isotherm and 0.9839 for pseudo-first-order kinetics indicate that the reaction in the dark follows the Freundlich isotherm, whereas the adsorption of the pollutant on the catalyst surface follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. In addition, the surface modification has a greater impact on the degradation of caffeine as evident from the 29% higher degradation ability of the CTAB-assisted polymeric CuO compared to its unmodified counterpart. Surface characterization of the obtained polymeric matrix revealed that the degradation is also affected by the smaller particle size, band gap, and morphology of the catalyst. The scavenging experiments suggest significant involvement of the singlet oxygen in the degradation of caffeine by reducing the degradation to 49.8% from 96.5% after the addition of the scavenger. Herein, a simplified view of the variable catalytic affinity brought about by the surface modifications of the photocatalyst with respect to the surfactant employed during the synthesis has been presented. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Adsorption; Caffeine; Photocatalysis; Singlet oxygen; Surface modification,Adsorption; Catalysts; Dyes; Energy gap; Isotherms; Kinetics; Metal nanoparticles; Morphology; Oxygen; Particle size; Photocatalysis; Reaction kinetics; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; Freundlich isotherm; Photocatalytic degradation; Physical adsorption; Polymeric matrices; Pseudo first-order kinetics; Pseudo-first order kinetics; Singlet oxygen; Surface-modification; Synthetic methods; Degradation,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR; CSIR-Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, CIMFR: MLP – 153, MLP – 157",M.

Central composite design (CCD) experimental matrices with different sets of variables (blend type: 10–40 % vol. of biodiesel; MgO NPs: 60–180 ppm; engine speed: 1000–2000 rpm; engine load: 40–100 %) were used to examine the engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption: BSFC; and brake thermal efficiency: BTE) and emission characteristics (carbon monoxide: CO; unburnt hydrocarbon: UHC; nitrous oxide: NOx). The MgO NPs are characterized by using an X-ray diffractometer: XRD, scanning electron microscope: SEM and transmission electron microscope: TEM and confirm the compositions and the crystallite particle size equal to 132 nm. The models developed for each output showed a better value of coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.9843 for BSFC, 0.9859 for BTE, 0.9772 for CO, 0.9777 for NOx, and 0.9368 for UHC. Grey relational analysis (GRA) with quality loss function (QLFs) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to correlate the multiple responses and transform multiple objective functions to single objective function necessary for optimization. Three population-based search algorithms, such as driving training-based optimization (DTBO) and election-based optimization algorithm (EBOA) and grey wolf optimization (GWO), were applied and evaluated their optimization performances. EBOA, DTBO and GWO determined the same optimal conditions and converged to 1000 iterations with a computational time equal to 2, 5 and 30 s, respectively. The algorithms determined optimal conditions produced better experimental values than GRA-based QLF and PCA with 31.27 % decrease in BSFC, 24.27 % decrease in CO, 4.64 % decrease in HC, 19.82 % decrease in NOx emissions, and 9.82 % decrease in BTE, respectively.

The salts formed directly from solutions of amitriptyline (which first hydrolysed to amitriptynol) and the corresponding acid in acetonitrile to form amitriptynolium [systematic name: (3-{2-hydroxytricyclo[9.4.0.03,8]pentadeca-1(11),3,5,7,12,14-hexaen-2-yl}propyl)dimethylazanium] 4-methoxybenzoate monohydrate, C20H26NO+·C8H7O3-·H2O, (I), amitriptynolium 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate trihydrate, C20H26NO+·C9H9O4-·3H2O, (II), amitriptynolium 2-chlorobenzoate, C20H26NO+·C7H4ClO2-, (III), and amitriptynolium thiophene-2-carboxylate monohydrate, C20H26NO+·C5H3O2S-·H2O, (IV). Compound (III) crystallizes with two cations, two anions and six water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The different conformations of the amitriptynolium cations are determined by the torsion angles in the dimethylamino-propyl chains and the –CH2–CH2- bridge between the benzene rings in the tricyclic ring system, and are complicated by disorder of the bridging unit in II and III. The packing in all four salts is dominated by N—H· · ·O and O—H· · ·O hydrogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analyses show that the amitriptynolium cations make similar inter-species contacts, despite the distinctly different packing in each salt. © 2023 International Union of Crystallography.

The solute is adsorbed at a rate proportionate to its concentration in the dispersion systems, which are susceptible to input concentrations that fluctuate exponentially with time. The advection-dispersion equation (ADE) was solved numerically in this work to analyze the pollutants transport bearing in mind the coefficient of distribution and permeability by considering pollutant input concentrations.

Objectives: In the present study hydrogels were prepared as a controlled drug delivery system taking Rosiglitazone as a model drug. Materials and Methods: Hydrogels were created using the Free Radical Polymerization approach, with the crosslinker N, N′-Methylene bisacrylamide serving as a binding agent for the polymerization. To create a polymeric network, ammonium persulphate has been used as a polymerization inducer for AAc to poly (acrylic acid) in the existence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVP). A maximum of fifteen formulations were created with various concentrations of polymers and crosslinking agents to test the swelling, diffusion coefficients, ESR, and in vitro drug release properties of the drugs tested. The FT-IR and DSC techniques were used to determine the drug's compatibility with the polymers. The XRD studies were carried out to understand the nature of the drug contained within the hydrogel formulation. The morphologies of the surface were determined using SEM. Results and Discussion: A greater swelling was observed in the basic pH range and a marginal swelling was observed in the acidic pH range according to the swelling studies. The ESR affirmed that the pH of the hydrogels was indeed a factor in the swelling of the gels. The results of the diffusion study revealed that the diffusion coefficient has risen as a result of the reduction in cross-linker concentration and the increase in acrylic acid concentration in the solution. The in vitro release of drug data revealed that the swelling has been increased as a result of the increased concentration of acrylic acid, which resulted in the increased release of the drug. However, when the concentrations of PVP and cross-linker were increased, it was discovered that the drug release was decreased. Conclusion: AAc-PVP based hydrogel was found to be a promising controlled drug delivery system for the treatment of Rosiglitazone, according to the findings of this study. © The Authors.",Antidiabetic Drug; Free Radical Polymerization; Hydrogels; PVP Acrylic acid,acrylic acid; antidiabetic agent; free radical; hydrogel; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; rosiglitazone; Article; chemical reaction kinetics; cross linking; differential scanning calorimetry; drug delivery system; drug formulation; drug release; drug solubility; drug stability; in vitro study; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; particle size; pH; physical chemistry; scanning electron microscopy; sustained release preparation; swelling; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; X ray diffraction,,"The authors are thankful to PES College of Pharmacy, Bangalore, and NETES Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Mirza, Assam, for providing the adequate resources and support in favour of the researcher to conduct the research presented in this article.",,,,,,,,,,"Talukdar, A.; NETES Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Santipur, Kamrup, Assam, India; email: ampurbatalukdar83@gmail.com",,Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India,195464,,,,English,Indian J.

The iron nanoparticles were uniformly embedded with different concentrations (5–25 wt%) of TeO2 (PPy/Fe@TeO2) as ternary nanocomposites on the surface of PPy, so-called in situ functionalization through the redox reaction between PPy/Fe, TeO2 and Green tea extract. The structural morphology was confirmed by various physicochemical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tunneling electron microscopy (TEM). Electrical conductivity (DC &amp; AC) and electromagnetic shielding interference (EMI) were recorded. The result shows that the DC conductivity increased as the weight percentage of TeO2 in the composite decreased. The DC conductivity also increases slightly with an increase in temperature from 303 to 378 K. In addition, the alternating current (AC) conductivity of PPy/Fe@TeO2 increases as a function of frequency, but this phenomenon was more strongly observed in the 15 wt% TeO2 composite. Compared to other materials, the EMI shielding performance of the composite with a 15 wt% TeO2 sample shows the largest performance loss between the 2.0 GHz and 3.0 GHz frequencies. The results show that the materials exhibit several desirable properties including AC, DC, and EMI shielding capabilities, and have the potential to be used in a variety of electronic applications such as biosensors and battery applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,Electric conductivity; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic shielding; Electromagnetic wave interference; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Iron; Iron compounds; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Polypyrroles; Redox reactions; Scanning electron microscopy; Signal interference; Alternating current; Electrical conductivity; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Electromagnetic shielding interferences; Green tea extracts; In-situ polymerization; Interference shielding; Iron nanoparticles; Polypyrrole (PPy); Ternary nanocomposites; Tellurium compounds,PESUIRF/Chemistry-ECC/2020/14,"The authors are thankful to the management of PES University, Electronic City Campus, Bangalore, for internal funding for the research program, PESUIRF/Chemistry-ECC/2020/14 date 30-09-2020.

In this study, graphite felt (GF) coated with conducting polymer/transition metal carbide nanocomposite (NPTiC) used to examine the electrochemical behavior for battery applications. Chemical oxidation has been employed to create the polyaniline (PANI) powder. Through a Mechano-chemical technique, nano-Titanium Carbide (NTiC) and nanocomposites (PANI with various proportions of 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 % of TiC) were created. XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM and TGA are used to characterize them. Studies of electrochemical performance such as Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out for PANI, NTiC and all nanocomposites. The results revealed excellent reversibility of an electron transfer and low impedance between the electrode and vanadium electrolyte compared to PANI and NTiC. Utilizing a 132 cm2 electrode, the study of charge-discharge for PANI, NTiC and NPTiC6 nanocomposite materials treated on GF (named as PANI/GF, NTiC/GF and NPTiC6/GF) as a positive electrode and untreated graphite felt (UTGF) retained as a negative electrode was done using a vanadium electrolyte and Nafion 117 membrane. The best performance is at 30 mA/cm2 current density and showed enhancements in coulombic efficiency (ղC), voltaic efficiency (ղV) and energy efficiency (ղE) than PANI and NTiC electrodes on GF. High Coulombic efficiency of 98.89 % was calculated for the NPTiC6/GF electrode. Even after 50 cycles, there was only 12 % coulombic efficiency decay, confirming the nanocomposite electrode's stability.

A complete Lampert triangle is observed in PF6- doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) [PEDOT:PF6] devices, fabricated in a stainless steel/PEDOT/Ag structure and synthesized by electro-polymerization at three different doping levels (high-S1, medium-S2, and low-S3). The temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics show three distinct regimes limited within a triangular region called the Lampert triangle: Ohmic, trap-limited/filling space charge-limited conduction (TFL-SCLC), and trap-free/trap-filled space charge-limited conduction (TF-SCLC). The vertices of the Lampert triangle represents the transition voltages (VT) for different conduction mechanisms, and the carrier density (p0), carrier transit time (tt), and relaxation time (td) for different doping levels are estimated through the analysis of the triangle. The mobility of carriers shows significant temperature dependence (Arrhenius type). The Jonscher's double power law fit to AC conductivity data shows that the exponent (in the range 0-1) varies with carrier density and has different trends in bulk and interface. The impedance data and Nyquist plots are analyzed with two parallel RQ circuits (R: resistance; Q: constant phase element) connected in series. The values of onset frequency (ωo) in the conductivity plot of the different samples (S1, S2, and S3) give insights into their relative disorder. Raman spectroscopy studies have attempted to corroborate the changes in bond deformation with carrier density in correlation with the structure and disorder. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",,Carrier transport; Current voltage characteristics; Electric space charge; Semiconducting polymers; Temperature distribution; Conduction Mechanism; Doping levels; Electro-polymerization; Ethylenedioxythiophenes; Power-law; Space charge limited conduction; Space-charge limited conduction; Synthesised; Temperature dependent; Triangle model; Carrier concentration,,,,,,,,,,,,"Roy, A.; Department of Physics, Tamilnadu, India; email: amitroy.iisc@gmail.com",,American Chemical Society,19327447,,,,English,J.

These conversations, in most cases are bimodal in nature, consisting of both images and text. Existing work in multimodal conversation typically focuses on individual utterances rather than the overall dialogue. The aspect of conversational health is important in many real world conversational uses cases including the emerging world of Metaverse. The work described in this paper investigates conversational health from the viewpoint of emotional concordance in bimodal conversations modelled as graphs. Using this framework, an existing multimodal dialogue dataset has been reformatted as a graph dataset that is labelled with the emotional concordance score. In this work, determination of conversational health has been framed as a graph classification problem. A graph neural network based model using algorithms such as Graph Convolution Network and Graph Attention Network is then used to detect the emotional concordance or discordance based upon the multimodal conversation that is provided. The model proposed in this paper achieves an overall F1 Score of 0.71 for equally sized class training and testing size, which offers improved results compared to previous models using the same benchmark dataset. © 2023 ACM.",Emotion Recognition; Graph classification; Graphs; Multimodal,Graph neural networks; Statistical tests; AS graph; Emotion recognition; Graph; Graph classification; Metaverses; Multi-modal; Multimodal conversation; Real-world; Social media; Social technologies; Emotion Recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,"Das, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: bhaskarjyotidas@pesu.pes.edu",,Association for Computing Machinery,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

A PPy/BaFe12O19 composite was structurally and morphologically investigated using x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Both electrical conducting and dielectric attributes have shown property modifications with varying concentrations of the dispersant, barium ferrite. The corrosion inhibition response of PPy/BaFe12O19 composites on an aluminum metal surface in 0.1 M NaOH solution was analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization, and AC impedance spectroscopy. The morphological features reconfirming the corrosion inhibition nature of the composites were recorded using SEM. Furthermore, a mixed corrosion inhibition property was confirmed by potentiodynamic polarization plots. EMI shielding and microwave attenuation characteristics of the composites were investigated in the practically relevant microwave broadband frequency spectrum of 8–12 GHz (X-band). The efficiency of these anticorrosive composites towards the suppression of ever-increasing EMI has been confirmed by the observed shielding efficiency in the range of − 23 dB to − 27 dB (&gt; 99% attenuation). © 2023, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",anticorrosion behavior; electrical properties; EMI shielding; PPy/BaFe12O19 composite; Raman spectroscopy,Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Efficiency; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic shielding; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Ferrite; Iron compounds; Polarization; Polypyrroles; Raman spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium hydroxide; Anti-corrosion; Anti-corrosive; Anticorrosion behavior; Barium ferrites; Corrosion inhibition; Electrical response; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Potentiodynamics polarization; PPy/bafe12O19 composite; Tunables; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,,"The authors are grateful to PES University, Bengaluru-560100, India, and the Oxford College of Engineering, Bommanahalli, Bengaluru-560068, India, for the support and encouragement.

Sorting is generally implemented on CPU or GPU, which takes several cycles to finish the sorting process. Further improvement in performance in sorting is possible through hardware acceleration either in FPGA or ASIC. The performance improvement and reducing the power consumption are the primary goals for researchers to improve the hardware acceleration of sorting algorithms. The sorting techniques like Bubble sort, Bitonic sort and Odd–even sort are found suitable for hardware implementation and widely discussed in the research literature. It is evident from the literature survey endeavors from researchers to make these sorting techniques more modular and low power, which is required to design large-scale sorting for data center-based applications. In this paper, we investigate application of generic and structured low-power technique like clock gating and Multi-Vth in designing the low-power sorters. The bubble sort, bitonic sort and odd–even sorting techniques are redesigned to make them low power using clock gating and multi-Vth technique. The implementation results show that the clock gating reduces the dynamic power consumption on sorters by 47.5% without much impact on the performance. Further performance improvement is achieved through adopting multi-Vth libraries without compromising the dynamic power reduction achieved through clock gating. The power reduction results obtained are comparable with state-of-the-art low-power sorters which are complex in design. The proposed sorters are implemented and results are presented for Saed90nm standard cell libraries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Clock gating; Low power design; Multi-Vth; Sorting architecture,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Preethi, P.; Presidency UniversityIndia; email: preethisrivathsa@gmail.com",,Springer,2662995X,,,,English,SN COMPUT.

However, its accumulation in the soil and aquatic habitats could be detrimental to their corresponding flora and fauna. Thus, its bioremediation by suitable microbes is crucial. The current study aims at evaluating the bioremediation properties of the endophytic bacterial strains isolated from the two Indian medicinal plants: Cuminum cyminum and Foeniculum vulgare. Medicinal plants are a rich source of numerous bioactive compounds having several therapeutic benefits. Thus, when it comes to the endosymbiotic microbiome thriving in them, aka the endophytic bacteria/fungi, there is a whole new field of research to explore regarding their metabolite potential and adaptive mechanisms. Initial screening was done by employing enrichment technique wherein SDS at a concentration of 1 g l–1 was the only carbon source. Out of 24 endophytic strains, 3 strains S8, S9 and R6 were detected to have SDS degrading capabilities. This was confirmed by the presence of clearance zones on the agar plate that substantiates the strain’s ability to degrade and intake of SDS. These 3 isolates and a positive control, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, were further subjected to higher concentrations of SDS ranging from 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 g l–1, to check the state of its degradation. The results were remarkable as it represented strain R6 was able to degrade higher concentration of SDS present in the medium, hence confirming that this can be used for environmental degradation of SDS. The S8 and R6 strains were identified as Pseudomona sp. based on 16 s rRNA sequencing technique. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.",Bacterial endophytes; Cuminum cyminum; Foeniculum vulgare; Microbial remediation; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate,,,This study was funded by PES University under the student project category.,,,,,,,,,,"Sabat, S.; Department of Biotechnology, Banashankari III Stage, Karnataka, India; email: sasmitasabat@pes.edu",,Springer,3698211,,,,English,Proc.

The bacterial enzyme Choline TMA Lyase found in several opportunistic gut commensals produces TMA, a precursor of TMAO. Proteus bacteria, a key contributor in several gastrointestinal diseases, is known to survive in the wide pH range of 2-10, offered by different locations of the GI tract. Currently, evidence characterising the functionality of the protein in the different compartments of the gut is lacking. This study aims at providing insights into the structural as well as functional stability of this protein in Proteus vulgaris in these environments. Homology modelling coupled with molecular docking studies reveals that Cys785, Asp512, Phe685 and Phe691 are key residues in influencing the functionality of choline trimethylamine-lyase.

The tethered organic linker, 2-[benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylthio)-3-hydroxyacrylaldehyde was commonly known as 2-mercaptobenimidazole analogue [2-MBIA]. Analysis of BET disclosed that addition of 2-MBIA to Cu-benzene dicarboxylic acid [Cu-BDC], reduced the crystallite size from 70.0 nm to 65.90 nm, surface area from 17.95 to 17.02 m2 g-1 and enhances the pore size from 5.84 nm with 0.027 cm3 g-1 pore volume to 8.74 nm with 0.361 cm3 g-1 pore volume. Batch experiments were conducted to optimize pH, adsorbent dosage, and, Congo red (CR) concentration. The adsorption percentage of CR on the novel MOFs was 54%. Adsorption kinetic studies revealed that the uptake adsorption capacity at equilibrium was 184.7 mg/g from pseudo-first-order kinetics which gave a good fit with the experimental data. Intraparticle diffusion model explained the process of the adsorption mechanism: diffusion from the bulk solution onto the porous surface of the adsorbent. Freundlich and Sips models were the best fit models of the several non-linear isotherm models. Temkin isotherm suggested the adsorption of CR on MOFs was of an exothermic nature. © 2023",2-Mercaptobenzimidazole analogue; Adsorption; Congo red; Cu-BDC MOFs,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Challa, M.; Department of Chemistry, Karnataka, India; email: maalathichalla@msrit.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,24058440,,,,English,Heliyon,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147271762,,,,,,,

Raman spectroscopy and XRD data suggest the successful formation of PEDOT-GNP nanocomposites and enhancement in the crystalline nature of the nanocomposites. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of PEDOT-GNP nanocomposites was studied in the X-band (8 to 12 GHz) frequency range. EMI shielding effectiveness of around 17.6 dB was obtained for PEDOT-15 wt% GNP [PG15] nanocomposite. This shows that, PG15 nanocomposite can attenuate around 90 % of incident electromagnetic radiation with absorption mechanism being the major contribution. Further, anticorrosion property of PEDOT-GNP nanocomposites on Al metal in 4 M HCl solution was studied by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Tafel plots (or potentiodynamic polarization), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. PG15 nanocomposite exhibited superior anticorrosion performance, with a protection efficiency of about 98 %, compared to other studied nanocomposites (about 94 % and 97 % for PEDOT-5 wt% GNP and PEDOT-10 wt% GNP nanocomposite, respectively) in a 4 M HCl environment. PG15 may be used as a coating material in situations where EMI shielding and anticorrosion are crucial. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Anticorrosion; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene); Polymer nanocomposites; Tafel plot","Absorption spectroscopy; Atomic absorption spectrometry; Chlorine compounds; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant coatings; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic shielding; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electromagnetic wave interference; Graphene; Signal interference; Anti-corrosion; Bi-functional; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Ethylenedioxythiophenes; Graphene nanoplatelets; Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene); Polymer nanocomposite; Polymer-nanocomposite; Shielding performance; Tafel plots; Nanocomposites","CRS/2021-22/01/435, KSTePS/VGST/03/CISEE/2015-2016/GRD-470; Indian Institute of Science, IISc; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Ministry of Education, India, MoE; Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity; UGC-DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, University Grants Commission, UGC-DAE CSR","SRM would like to thank the UGC-DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, Government of India and Vision Group on Science and Technology ( VGST ), Department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science & Technology, Government of Karnataka for financial support under project nos.

Current study investigates the impact of modified DSWH with Kenics insert brazed with rod and spacer sequentially on the heat augmentation, and flow pressure, and frictional attributes. The thermal performance and flow friction characteristics have also been analyzed for different rod and spacer lengths such as 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 m for twist designed with a stable twist ratio of 3. Experimental results reveal the drop in Nusselt number when the rod and the spacer span increase; and the flow pressure drop (ΔP) decreases significantly while extending the same in comparison with full kenics twist. Further, the increment in pressure drop and heat removal was observed significantly in twist and rod inserts of minimum twist ratio and rod length compared to twist and spacer combination.

The conduction and relaxation mechanisms have been studied by impedance spectroscopy over the frequency range from 40 Hz to 10 MHz and at various temperatures. With constant transition metal oxide content, the conductivity variation in the glasses is assumed to be mainly due to an ionic contribution. The dependence of electrical conductivity on frequency has been analysed using Jonscher's power law. Properties of the glasses, such as electric modulus loss and relaxation mechanism, have been analysed in terms of electric modulus using the Kohlrausch–William–Watts (KWW) equation, which describes the relaxation behaviour of the mobile ions as non-Debye in nature. Scaling of ac conductivity and electric modulus data has shown that conductivity relaxation is independent of temperature. The non-monotonic variation in the stretching parameter β has been found to show a positive correlation with various activation energies, namely electrical activation energy, relaxation activation energy, and the activation energy from the Anderson–Stuart model. The anomalous behaviour of activation energy with respect to conductivity has been substantiated through structural insight. The conductivity was found to be highest in glasses with 25 mol% Li2O, while coupling between the mobile ions was best for glasses with 20 mol% Li2O. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Activation energy; Electric modulus; Impedance spectroscopy; Jonscher's power law; Kohlrausch–William–Watts (KWW); Relaxation mechanism,Barium compounds; Dielectric properties; Electric conductivity; Electric losses; Glass; Lithium; Spectroscopy; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Electric modulus; Electrical conductivity; Electrical relaxations; Impedance spectroscopy; Jonscher power laws; Kohlrausch; Kohlrausch–william–watt; Mobile ions; Relaxation mechanism; Williams; Activation energy,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी: SR/FST/College-324/2016; Vision Group on Science and Technology, VGST: KFIST L2 GRD No. 648(2017–18",PG is grateful to Principal and management of St. Joseph's College for their support in her doctoral work.

A DDoS attack occurs when a large amount of internet traffic is directed at a single server or network in an effort to overwhelm it and disrupt regular operations. According to reports from Cloudfare HTTP DDoS attacks increased by a huge percentage of 111% from 2021 to 2022. In fact, current studies and statistics predict that in 2023, the number of DDOS attacks will rise by nearly 300%. This poses a substantial risk to both corporations and individuals because these assaults have the potential to seriously harm websites that are tied to both. A defense mechanism for DDoS has become crucial for key enterprises and government organizations due to their capacity to interrupt network services and cause damages. Previously related work established that shallow and deep learning classifiers were highly useful and detecting and classifying DDoS attacks. Despite this, there hasn’t been much research on the The time-based characteristics and classification of the various DDoS assault kinds. As a result, the proposed model examines the efficiency using time-based criteria in recognising and categorising different DDoS attack types with stacking ensemble technique combining various models for the best accuracy in order to detect the DDoS attack. © 2023 IEEE.",DDoS; Ensemble; Stacking; Time-based characteristics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

One of the features is that it infers dependencies between the endpoints hence it is stateful and it tries to minimize the number of test cases by checking for consecutive 404s. The test cases that generate random data are done by the Hypothesis Library.

A self-defending and anticipatory network aims to address this problem by proactively identifying potential threats, anticipating attacks, and automatically responding to them in real time. In this paper, the authors suggest a new kind of decentralized architecture for a self-defending network wherein each node in the network maintains a data structure called Failure Probability Table or FPT to keep track of other nodes behavior. The value in the FPT for each node will be decided on the basis of real time machine learning algorithms. The FPT values help in isolating the node, and also pre-emptive rerouting to minimize the effects on the network based on certain thresholds. This novel approach of each node having its own FPT values has the potential to substantially enhance the robustness of network security, effectively countering sophisticated attacks and fortifying against evolving threats in a proactive manner. © 2023 IEEE.",anticipatory network; attack anticipation; decentralized architecture; evolving threats; Failure Probability Table; node behavior tracking; node isolation; potential threats; proactive identification; reactive nature; real time machine learning algorithms; self-defending network,Cybersecurity; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network architecture; Anticipatory network; Attack anticipation; Behavior tracking; Decentralized architecture; Evolving threat; Failure Probability; Failure probability table; Machine learning algorithms; Node behavior tracking; Node isolation; Potential threats; Proactive identification; Probability tables; Reactive nature; Real time machine learning algorithm; Real- time; Self-defending network; Time machine; Network security,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rohith, S.; Pes University, Bangalore, India; email: rohiths2002@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"iQ-CCHESS - IEEE Int.

Different driving modes are offered by modern cars to accommodate various road conditions and driver preferences. However, manually selecting these modes can be cumbersome. Addressing the dynamic nature of mode switching in autonomous driving systems presents a multifaceted challenge. The system must continuously assess a multitude of variables such as traffic patterns, road conditions, weather conditions, and the wear and tear of vehicle components. Traffic conditions can change rapidly, requiring real-time analysis of traffic flow and congestion. Road conditions, including the presence of obstacles, construction zones, or slippery surfaces, demand instant adaptation for safe navigation. Weather conditions further complicate the scenario, as rain, snow, fog, or even intense sunlight can impact visibility and road grip. Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated algorithms capable of processing vast amounts of data from various sensors in real time. Machine learning models must be trained to recognize patterns in diverse conditions, enabling the system to make informed decisions swiftly and accurately. Moreover, the system must possess the ability to prioritize these factors based on their immediate impact on driving safety and efficiency. This can be a future enhancement of the paper. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the mode selection process can be automated. The system constantly monitors driving conditions, learns from real-time camera sensor data and selects the most optimal mode to adapt to current situation.

A NIDS raises an alarm when an attack or a violation is discovered so that the network administrator can respond appropriately. Network intrusion solutions that rely on machine learning functions using flow characteristics obtained through flow exporting protocols. The applicability of machine learning for NIDS systems assumes that such traffic information is gathered from every packet in the flow. However, in actual use, flow exporters are frequently installed on convenient devices like routers, and switch where processing each flow requires certain bandwidth and memory consumption and thus requires a packet sampling technique. Application of such ML-based NIDS solutions where there is uncertainty in the sampling process. Even in the presence of sampling, it can still offer a reliable assessment of NIDS. Through sampling studies, we can observe that even with low sample rates malignant flows of a smaller size are likely to go undetected. The proposed system indicates a procedure to investigate sampling techniques on NIDS. The detection rate is computed for dynamic sampling rates for a simple random sampling approach, Sketchflow sampling, and hybrid sampling approach by evaluated using Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost machine learning algorithms. The results of the experiments demonstrate that in comparison to other classifiers Random Forest offers a greater detection rate of 99.3% and a lower false alarm rate through the sampling technique. © 2023 IEEE.",Flow features; Network Intrusion Detection; Sampling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

The resulting nanomaterials exhibited a uniform particle size distribution, which is crucial for their photocatalytic efficiency. ZnO nanoparticles with a uniform particle size of 25 nm were successfully synthesized using a sonochemical route and were employed for the degradation of direct green and fast orange dyes under UV light irradiation. The band gap of the ZnO nanoparticles was determined to be 3.35 eV, indicating its potential as a photocatalyst for dye degradation. The degradation efficiency of the dyes was evaluated by monitoring the change in their concentration over time. The ZnO nanoparticles demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity, efficiently degrading both dyes within a relatively short duration. The electrochemical studies further confirmed the potential applicability of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles in various electrochemical systems. The ZnO electrode that was produced could detect lead in an acidic solution. The ZnO electrode is a promising electrode material for making sensor applications because of its higher electrochemical behaviour.

The purpose of VANETs is to improve road safety and traffic efficiency by enabling vehicles to exchange information with each other and with roadside units. However, VANETs are not resilient to attacks and can be hacked by the attackers to spread misleading information. Therefore, a preventive measure against such attacks is needed to identify these types of messages and ensure safety. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be used to improve network security and provides protection from various types of attacks. To classify the messages received as false or not and to improve the accuracy of false message detection, an IDS based on popular machine learning classification models which is trained on Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) data in both attack and normal scenarios is introduced. Since reliability of communication and dynamic network topology are the main concern in VANETs, packet delivery ratio, packet sent ratio and signal strength of the vehicle communication are considered to be most the important aspect in the proposed model to help determine the authenticity of the message received. Finally, the analysis includes a comprehensive comparison of various classification models supported by statistics and graphs.

The rising incidence of hate speech on these platforms necessitates vigilant monitoring and intervention. However, the sheer volume of user-generated content renders manual oversight infeasible. Technological solutions must be developed to efficiently identify and mitigate hate speech, striking a balance between maintaining open expression and safeguarding against harmful content. Additionally, when utilizing traditional machine learning methodologies as prediction methods, the language being utilized and the length of the messages provide a barrier. In this study, a Genetic Programming (GP) model for identifying hate speech is presented, where each chromosome acts as a classifier with a universal sentence encoder feature. The performance of the GP model was enhanced by enriching the offspring pool with alternative solutions using a unique mutation strategy that only modifies the feature values in addition to the conventional one-point mutation technique. For the six categories of hate-type hate speech text datasets, the suggested GP model beat all cutting-edge solutions.

An effective low power-delay MUX architecture is needed to boost data transmission efficiency, effectively use a computer's enormous memory, and convert parallel data into serial form in telecommunication networks. Thus, a basic 4:1 MUX is created using a variety of CMOS logic families, including static CMOS logic, pseudo-NMOS logic, Domino logic, dynamic logic, multiplexers using a transmission gate, and dual-rail Domino logic, to determine the best suitable logic family for creating higher levels of MUX. VLSI technology is used for implementation, as it has features like small size, low cost, high operating speed, and low power. Using a VLSI back-hand tool, Cadence VIRTUOSO SCHEMATIC EDITOR 6.1 at 180nm, the performance analysis of the MUX using various CMOS logic families is carried out. A 4:1 MUX based on Domino logic is found to be the most effective based on the results. Its PDP (power delay product) is 20.1% lower than that of other logic families, and its average power consumption is 20.06%. But trade-offs are inferred between Domino logic and static CMOS logic, which can be neglected when considering overall performance. This work suggests that any higher-level MUX with low power-delay and PDP can be achieved using Domino logic as it outperforms the other logic families. © 2023 IEEE.",domino logic; dynamic logic; MUX; power analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chiranjeevi, G.N.; PES University-EC Campus, Karnataka, India; email: chiranjeevign@pes.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Instrumentation amplifiers play a pivotal role in various applications, particularly in biomedical amplifiers and audio instrumentation systems, where they excel at capturing signals amidst significant noise. By incorporating the folded cascode amplifier, this design ensures both high gain and high output voltage swing, all while maintaining lower power consumption. The proposed design comprises a two-stage operational amplifier (op-amp) in the input stage, complemented by a folded cascode stage amplifier in the output stage. The design process begins with an explanation of the designs of the two-stage op-amp and folded cascode amplifier followed by a comparison of their results. Finally, an instrumentation amplifier integrating both are designed and analyzed. This work is designed and simulated for 90nm CMOS Technology on Cadence Virtuoso with a 1.2V power supply and input common mode voltage of 800mV. Overall, the designed INA achieves an optimal gain of 47.7dB along with CMRR (Common Mode Rejection Ratio) of 98.25dB and PSRR (Power Supply Rejection Ratio) of 109.4dB with a bandwidth of 1.25MHz.

This study aims to use radiology reports (fetal ultrasound scans) to predict abnormalities and drive the critical decisions related to fetal health and termination. Two different machine learning approaches (CNN, Vision Transformer) were adopted and the resulting models were compared on their performance at predicting the presence of three fetal abnormalities (Cystic Hygroma, Absence of Nasal Bone, Ventriculomegaly). Results showed that the Vision Transformer model performed better and with a higher rate of consistency as compared to the CNN model. It was concluded that the Vision Transformer is a more reliable model for the prediction of these three abnormalities.

A paramount challenge within this realm is the establishment of stringent security protocols to safeguard sensitive information and thwart unauthorized access. Although various strategies have been conceived and implemented to fortify data protection in IoT environments, the unique resource limitations intrinsic to IoT devices necessitate further exploration. The criticality of efficient time and memory management for the optimization of IoT application performance cannot be overstated. This paper elucidates the efficacy of employing lightweight blockchain technology as a bulwark to secure numerous IoT applications. It introduces a symmetric cryptographic algorithm, known as Blowfish, tailored for the secure transmission of data within IoT networks. A novel key generation phase has been developed, demonstrating an adept utilization of time and memory resources on IoT devices for the encryption of transaction data. Furthermore, these transactions are recorded within a blockchain database, capitalizing on its inherent immutability. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme surpasses contemporary algorithms, including AES and 3DES, with regard to encryption time and memory overhead for key generation.

However, quantifying a good reading habit can be challenging as there is no consensus on how to best measure it. A good reading habit is important in every individual as it has an invariable impact on cognitive development and intellectual improvement. Lack of reading habits is a significant problem among Indian youth. Understanding why reading is not a prevalent aspect of modern culture and finding a novel method to inculcate reading habits in casual readers is the focus of this work. To achieve this, a 'user-in-the-loop' approach to Engineering Design (UILED) was adopted with a specific problem identified: 'Casual readers lose interest in reading due to limited time, vocabulary, understanding, and a lack of immersive reading content, which leads to poor reading habits.' A design intervention (DI) was proposed, with stakeholder feedback and concerns considered at each stage. The DI thus created is a foldable reading device that emphasises the development and inculcation of a reading habit, while also providing translational, aural, and visual assistance. The DI was taken to expert stakeholders for verification, and, after multiple rounds of feedback and iteration, the final DI was produced. © 2023 IEEE.",'user-in-the-loop' approach to engineering design; AI-assisted reading; digital reading device; human-centred design; reading habits,'user-in-the-loop' approach to engineering design; AI-assisted reading; Cognitive development; Digital reading; Digital reading device; Engineering design; Human-centred designs; Novel methods; Reading habit; Specific problems; Iterative methods,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rao, S.; Pes University, India; email: shamita.rao@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Glob.

In addition to this, safety of the inventory also becomes important to reduce any risks of theft leading to potential loss to the owners. In this paper, design of a real-time stock inventory management system is proposed. An application is also developed for the end user to monitor and access the real-time inventory management system. The proposed system is implemented using three machine learning models - You Only Look Once (YOLO), Single Shot Detector (SSD) and Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) and their performances are compared in the proposed work. The performance evaluation of the proposed system is carried out using real-time videos captured from a laptop camera. The proposed system yielded an average precision of 0.92, 0.893 and 0.89 with an average recognition time of 1.33s, 0.33s, and 1.81s on using YOLO, SSD, and Faster-RCNN algorithm respectively.

The primary goal of wearable sensor technology is to collect and instantly transmit a patient's health-related data. For real-time health monitoring of critical patients, data of varying sizes must be transferred quickly, effectively, and in a prioritized manner. In this paper, we focus on prioritizing the data captured by various wearable devices, equipped by the patients. The data captured and generated in such cases will be heterogeneous in nature and transmitted at different rates. The prioritization is done on the MAC layer by varying the back-off time experienced by data of various priorities. We have given higher priority data lesser backoff time intervals compared to lower priority data, thus transferring it faster and reducing its latency. As wearable sensors have power, memory, and other resource constraints, Routing protocol for low power and lossy Network (RPL) is the best-suited routing protocol for such networks.

The antenna design is realized on an RT Duroid 5880 substrate with a dielectric constant (cr) of 2.2 and a height of 1mm. Operating predominantly within the 4GHz to 4.2GHz range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the 1x4 conformal antenna array has been meticulously simulated and tested in both planar and conformal configurations. Notably, its performance remains robust even when subjected to bending, thanks to the incorporation of a CSRR DGS structure within the ground plane. The feeding mechanism employed in this design utilizes a power divider network matched to a 50Ω impedance. Remarkable results have been achieved, with return loss values of S11=-25.15 and -29.52 dBi recorded at 3.987GHz and 4.2GHz, respectively, in the conformal version under bent conditions. Furthermore, the simulated directivity of the antenna array reaches 10.8dBi and 11dBi at the aforementioned frequencies, demonstrating its efficacy and resilience in demanding operational scenarios.

The effectiveness of the bearing is assessed by using a couple stress liquid as the lubricant in the process. Because of microstructural impacts, couple stress fluids have distinctive rheological characteristics. These features have the potential to make a major impact on the bearing's performance. The novel aspect of this study is that the roughness of the secant slider is taken into consideration. The modified Reynolds equation is derived using Christensen's stochastic theory for roughness. Here, both transverse and longitudinal roughness patterns are considered. The analytical solutions are obtained for steady-state pressure, load-carrying capacity, film stiffness, and damping coefficient. The results are presented for various parameters through graphs and tables. The combined effect of the magnetic field and couple stress is significant on bearing characteristics. It is noticed that the bearing features increase with the longitudinal roughness parameter, and the reverse phenomenon is observed with the transverse roughness parameter. When a transverse roughness pattern is assumed on a secant slider bearing, characteristics like pressure, load, stiffness of the film, and damping coefficient increase significantly. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.",couple stress; magnetic field; roughness; Secant slider bearing,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Karthik, K.; Department of Studies and Research in Mathematics, Karnataka, India; email: karthik.dumaths@gmail.com",,World Scientific,2179849,,MPLBE,,English,Mod.

The network configuration includes a single source node and two destination nodes among which one the node act as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay node. This is similar to the existing research on DS NOMA setup, which primarily focused on additive white Gaussian noise. In this setup, both the source and relay transmit data to the destination node using NOMA across two consecutive time frames. We provide mathematical expressions for outage probabilities at both nodes in the context of Bernoulli-Gaussian noise.

Radars and lidars are used in such applications where the range-doppler matrix representations are common and found to be very useful. In this paper, we address the problem of target localization from a range-doppler two-dimensional (2D) matrix in latency-sensitive radar systems which support hardware acceleration. The proposed algorithms consist of three key steps, namely (a) initial background noise filtering and binarization, (b) artifact filtering, and (c) 2D target localization. We use K-means clustering and morphology to filter background noise and artifacts respectively. To implement the 2D target localization effectively, we propose a novel two-layer connected components algorithm, which reduces the computations and hence latency in target localization compared to the conventional connected components algorithm up to 64.37%. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in the presence of additive noise, which is compared with existing methods. © 2023 IEEE.",Connected component algorithm; K-means algorithm; morphology; range-doppler matrix; two-layer connected component algorithm,Additive noise; K-means clustering; Matrix algebra; Background noise; Connected component algorithm; K-mean algorithms; matrix; Range doppler; Range-dopple matrix; Target localization; Two-layer; Two-layer connected component algorithm; Morphology,,,,,,,,,,,,"Joshi, D.; Pes University, India; email: dheerj188@gmail.com",,IEEE Computer Society,23248432,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE/IFIP Int.

It has the potential to sway the minds of the public which passively consumes their information without verifying its content. This happens due to an abundance of unverified sources available online, which accelerates the spread of fake news. It occurs primarily through regional languages, where minimal fact-checking is done. There is a dire need to identify these news articles and stop the propagation of misinformation through these platforms. Due to a scarcity of resources for detecting false news in Hindi, the creation of a comprehensive, high-quality dataset was necessary. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of 15355 fake news articles and 18849 real news articles, as well as a Supervised Machine Learning technique for detecting Hindi false news using grammatical features. As Support Vector Machine(SVM) is one of the most sophisticated yet simple-to-implement algorithms, different variants of SVM were compared. Ensemble learning techniques such as Adaboost were also explored. With an accuracy of 87.71%, linear SVM fared significantly better than all the other variants.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a pivotal technology in revolutionizing computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The domain of sports, specifically cricket, has also experienced a surge in the adoption of CNNs. Consequently, this paper employs a CNN architecture to accurately classify different types of batting shots played by cricketers. The proposed methodology involves the extraction of video frames capturing the batsman in action, which are subsequently fed into a pre-trained CNN model. To enhance the model's performance in shot classification, transfer learning is employed to fine-tune the pre-trained network. Additionally, the paper delves into the realm of dismissal prediction in cricket using computer vision. This prediction is based on analyzing the length of the delivered ball and the batsman's position during the moment of delivery. By evaluating the accuracy of the prediction model for specific batsmen, a comprehensive analysis is provided to assess its effectiveness. The integration of deep learning and computer vision presents substantial potential for advancing cricket analysis. The outcomes of this study can also be extended to other sports, facilitating further enhancements in game analysis and thereby improving players performance. © 2023 IEEE.",CNN; Dismissal Prediction; Logistic regression; Transfer Learning,Computer hardware; Computer vision; Deep learning; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Object detection; Sports; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Dismissal prediction; Images classification; Images segmentations; Learning techniques; Logistics regressions; Neural network architecture; Objects detection; Transfer learning; Video frame; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paturi, S.R.; Pes University, India; email: ramyapaturi9@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Regardless, due to the increase in mobility and complex communication environments, it has become challenging to dispense different requirements such as the decrease in latency and an increase in reliability for communicating information related to safety. With the use of distributed algorithms, routing vehicular data from one vehicle to another vehicle over multiple hops has been done in literature before. An approach using distributed algorithms would yield inefficient to have control over the congestion of the network. To overcome this, Software Defined Networking's coordination capacities are leveraged to find the ideal vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) multi-hop routes. In order to accomplish this goal, a centralized routing algorithm known as Congestion-Aware Routing (CAR) is employed utilizing principles from graph theory to select efficient and uncongested paths for communication between vehicles. © 2023 IEEE.",5G-Enabled Vehicular Networks; Congestion-Aware Routing; Heterogeneous Networks; Software-Defined Network; V2V communication,5G mobile communication systems; Graph theory; Network routing; Software defined networking; Traffic congestion; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; 5g-enabled vehicular network; Communication environments; Congestion-aware routing; Multiple hops; Routings; Software-defined networkings; Software-defined networks; V2V communications; Vehicular communications; Vehicular networks; Heterogeneous networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chakrabarti S.Paul R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

Many different composites were developed, each with its own set of characteristics and capabilities because to the wide range of fibres used. The measured bulk density values were often relatively low, with the lowest recorded value being only 180 kg m-3. The thermal conductivity was reduced to below 30 mW m-1 K-1 and the stability was maintained up to 600°C.

The navigation approach is determined by the particle swarm theory, with the robots serving as the swarm's agents. It moves to a destination location by avoiding impediments, maintaining group compactness, and using the attraction and repulsion forces typical of swarm particle systems. Here, each agent independently uses YOLO 5 to find the victims. When the agents agree that a victim may be present, a robot is chosen based on the Election by Consensus protocol.

The DL architecture exploits long short-term memory (LSTM), by utilizing two identical LSTM-based deep neural networks (DNNs) to concurrently decode the common and private streams, within a multicarrier framework. Termed as VLC with RSMA and LSTM-based DNN (ViRSMALNet), this detector overcomes the limitations in successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers, and decodes the RSMA messages from the combined signal in a single step. Extensive simulations based on Monte Carlo methods are executed to assess the symbol error rate (SER) performance of ViRSMALNet across diverse modulation schemes. The results establish that ViRSMALNet outperforms SIC-based least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detectors, and closely attains the performance of the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector. Further, this study also investigates the influence of factors such as the number of light-emitting diodes per fixture, the number of photodetectors per user, and the DNNs&#x2019; hyperparameters on the SER performance.

In recent decades, the industry has expanded exponentially. Effective infrastructure implementation and management are the key to sustaining this development. Fiber optics has become the principal infrastructure and the means of connectivity for the present and evolving technologies, offering greater bandwidth capacities at higher speeds. As the need for new technologies and services increases, fiber optics provides the promise of a network platform that is flexible, scalable, comprehensive in service, and has the potential for limitless capacity. Mobile network providers have made significant and strategic investments in fiber optic infrastructure; nevertheless, the frequency of network disruptions caused by recurrent fiber optic network failures, such as fiber cable breakage, has risen as a result. In India, cable cuts have been the single most common cause of telecommunications transmission failure or interruption, which has a significant impact on the subscriber’s overall experience with the service provider. This chapter focuses on the difficulties associated with fiber cable deployment in India, with a particular emphasis on the economic, regulatory, and managerial difficulties. It is possible that external causes, such as dig-ups during road building, are a result of the problems associated with frequent fiber cutting.

Thousands of these optical fibers are arranged in optical cable bundles and used to relay long distance light signals. Wide-scale signal transmission with low delay is the main necessity in today’s world. With the use of optical fiber today, high-speed transmission in telecommunications networks is carried out via optical fibers, which have low latency and are the preferred medium. The new fiber that permits 21 times more bandwidth in communications networks is currently available. A major pre-requisite in current applications is wide data transmission (bandwidth) of signal with low delays. Optical fibers, which have modest expectations in terms of huge and incomparable transmission speeds, are the transmission medium of choice in media transmission systems because of their long separation and high information transfer rates.

To identify compounds with the appropriate physio-chemical characteristics for these drugs, researchers often rely on iterative organic synthesis and high-failure-rate screening. There exists several hundred of these characteristics that are taken into consideration while developing a drug. One such significant characteristic is the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, i.e., identifying drug penetration into the central nervous system. This property is vital for medicines that are developed for ailments such as Alzheimer's. In an effort to expedite the overall process as well as save resources, the world of in-silico models was ventured into. These models leverage computer experimentation as opposed to in-vivo and in-vitro studies. The analysis began with an investigation of multiple machine-learning approaches for predicting the permeability of a given compound. This was followed by an exploration of deep learning methods, including neural networks, to achieve the highest possible accuracy in these predictions. After comparing these different approaches, a conclusion was drawn that took the form of a Graph Convolution Neural Network and produced results with an accuracy of 91% and an AUROC score of 96.7%. The model has additionally proved to be highly accurate for external evaluation and may be used for early CNS drug screening. © 2023 IEEE.",Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB); Central Nervous System; Chemoinformatics; Graph Convolution Neural Networks,Blood; Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Failure analysis; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Blood-brain barrier; Central nervous systems; Chemical characteristic; Chemoinformatics; Convolution neural network; Drug researchers; Graph convolution neural network; Machine-learning; Physio-chemical; Forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sm, N.; PES University, India; email: nishanthsm01@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

This research focuses on the synergistic integration of three cutting-edge technologies: 256-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access), and hybrid beamforming within the optical OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) framework. The aim is to investigate their combined potential for revolutionizing optical communication networks and meeting the escalating demands of 5G and beyond. The methodology employed in this research entails extensive simulations and analytical assessments to gauge the performance of the proposed system under diverse channel conditions and operational scenarios. Metrics such as bit error rate (BER), spectral efficiency, and capacity are scrutinized to provide insights into the system's efficiency and scalability. The amalgamation of 256-QAM, NOMA, and hybrid beamforming is expected to yield exponential gains in spectral efficiency, thereby optimizing the utilization of precious spectral resources.

Therefore, identifying the cable is important before its use. Aging or other factors can make cables inaccessible, such as underground cables that can lose their markings or have torn or worn labels. By analyzing the behaviors of a particular fiber type, it is possible to classify using machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Meanwhile, the possibilities of quantum computing are still being explored in terms of advantages and limitations. The idea of making the best use of both machine learning and quantum computing is the foundation for this work. So, the problem statement of the current project was to first implement the classical KNN algorithm and then develop an efficient KNN algorithm with the support of quantum technology. Finally, the classical and quantum-based KNN algorithms are compared in terms of time complexity and prediction accuracy. During the project, it was found that the quantum KNN algorithm can achieve the same accuracy as conventional algorithms, along with reducing the complexity, i.e., classical version has log complexity whereas quantum version has quadratic complexity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Cable classification; KNN; Machine learning; Optical fiber; Quantum computing; Quantum KNN,Cables; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum computers; Cable classification; Fiberoptic cables; Fibre-optic cables; K-near neighbor; Machine-learning; Nearest-neighbor algorithms; Nearest-neighbour; Quantum Computing; Quantum K-near neighbor; Optical fibers,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhowmick, K.; PES University/ECEIndia; email: kaustavbhowmick@pes.edu",Sharma S.Subudhi B.Sahu U.K.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18761100,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

Web crawlers are becoming more important since big data is used in numerous different sectors and web data is rising dramatically each year. However, when analyzing large volumes of information and making rapid decisions, the organization frequently uses minimal data, which leads to inefficient choices. In this paper, the minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization and radial basis function SVM are proposed to assist organizations in the targeted crawling of relevant online artifacts and semantically matching them against internal big data for better strategy decisions. The proposed method has been used and extensively evaluated in the e-procurement field. The minibatch SGD optimization and radial basis function SVM has gradually been expanded to include more fields such as robot programming and cloud hosting. The existing methods of web crawler for pharmacokinetics (WCPK), automatic extraction method, malicious website detection techniques, and BERT with softmax layer method are used to justify the effectiveness of the proposed minibatch SGD optimization and the radial basis function SVM method.

It is difficult to examine both inter-series and intra-series temporal correlations at the same time. However, several recent research in the time domain have attempted to capture both correlations but numerous analyses only capture the correlations of temporal and rely on pre-determined priors as inter-series interactions. In this paper, an attention-based spectral temporal graph neural network (AStemGNN) is proposed for traffic flow prediction and identifying the critical node/link graph network. In the spectrum domain, both the correlations of inter-series and temporal dependency are captured by AStemGNN. It incorporates graph fourier transforms (GFT), which describe the correlations of inter-series, and discrete fourier transform (DFT) which represent temporal dependencies. Following the execution of GFT and DFT, the spectrum representations retain patterns and it was predicted efficiently by the modules of convolution and sequential learning. Furthermore, an AStemGNN automatically identifies the correlations of inter-series data without employing the help of pre-defined priors. The efficacy of the AStemGNN method is demonstrated by employing the PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets. The existing methods such as attention-based spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ASTGNN), static and dynamic spatial correlation neural networks (SDSCNN), dynamic graph convolutional recurrent imputation networks (DGCRIN), and graph and attentive multi-path convolutional network (GAMCN) are used to justify the efficacy of the AStemGNN. When compared with the existing methods such as ASTGNN, SDSCNN, DGCRIN, and GAMCN, the AStemGNN achieves 0.65%, 1.12% mean absolute error (MAE), 0.78%, 1.05% root mean squared errors (RMSE), and 1.57%, 2.19% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in both PEMS04, PEMS08 datasets respectively. © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

But, in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, differentiating abnormal tissues is a challenging task. In this paper, a weight-based AdaBoost algorithm is proposed for an effective detection and classification of the breast cancer. An AdaBoost algorithm effectively classifies the breast cancer classes by adding the weights to the samples in the week classifier during the training phase. A weighted vote is performed on the results of each week classifier, and the strong classifier is integrated according to the weight of the week classifier. The breast cancer image datasets named CBIS-DDSM and MIAS are utilized for effective classification. Tumor-like regions (TLRs) are diagnosed by utilizing the optimum method of Otsu thresholding to enhance training abilities. The convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures of the AlexNet and ResNet50 are utilized for the feature extraction. A weight-based AdaBoost algorithm is proposed for the classification of breast cancer mammogram images into four classes benign calcification (BC), malignant calcification (MC), benign mass (BM) as well and malignant mass (MM). The results shows that the proposed weight based AdaBoost algorithm delivers the performance metrics such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and F1-score values about 99.56%, 99.38%, 99.40%, 98.89% and 99.18% respectively, which ensures the accurate classification results compared with the existing methods such as IMPA-ResNet50, Gray difference weight and MSER detector, MLO and CC methods. © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

An MQ-3 sensor is connected to an Arduino Uno board which processes the data from the sensor and triggers appropriate responses depending on the alcohol concentration level. The integration of a buzzer, push button, and LED enhances the functionality of the system by providing real-time alerts and visual indications to the user.

Therefore, reducing expenses and raising crop productivity are essential. In a country like India, where there are hundreds of fields, weeds are always growing there. Weeds and crops fight for space, water, food, nutrients, and other resources, which reduces agricultural output. Currently, one of agriculture's most difficult duties is weed control. Herbicide hand spraying is one of the most popular weed management techniques. However, this strategy has a number of shortcomings. Because manual labor is costly, an automated weed management system may be economically viable. There is currently no technology available that can be utilized in the field in real time to autonomously control in-row weeds, despite repeated attempts. Weed control has become more important as food grain production has increased per person. The suggested system makes an effort to provide a robotic, computer vision-based Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for real-time weed management in row crops in order to address the aforementioned issues. This tool can recognize weeds and remove them gently without endangering the environment. It would be ideal to achieve crop contact without the involvement of humans using IoT, machine learning, and picture analysis. © 2023 IEEE.",Image Processing; Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Robotic Arm; Unmanned Ground Vehicle,Agricultural robots; Computer vision; Crops; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet of things; Machine learning; Weed control; Agricultural output; Agriculture sectors; Crop productivity; Economic expansion; Images processing; Machine-learning; Real- time; Unmanned ground vehicle; Weed management; Weed plants; Ground vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sandeep Telkar, R.; Shivamogga and Visvesveraya Technological University, Karnataka, India; email: sandeep.dcn@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

With the advent of advanced technologies, glucose level monitoring systems have evolved to provide accurate and convenient solutions for individuals living with diabetes. The paper presents a comprehensive review of the various technologies and applications employed in glucose level monitoring systems. The earlier method provides an overview of the conventional methods for glucose monitoring, such as fingerstick blood glucose meters. While widely used, these methods have limitations in terms of invasiveness, discomfort, and the inability to capture continuous glucose data. To address these limitations, the proposed method discusses the emergence of non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques. system. The paper explores the integration of glucose level monitoring systems with the Blynk app to monitor the data remotely using smartphone applications and wearable devices which may incorporate the glucose and Heart Rate (HR) sensors and an OLED display for user interface. The benefits of integrations, such as enhanced user experience, remote monitoring, and data accessibility, are highlighted.

These engines make use of fossil fuels which are not just going to get depleted in due course; they are also a major cause of air pollution. Burning fossil fuels causes large emission of heat trapping gases which are responsible for the climatic changes being witnessed on our planet. There is an immediate need therefore to shift to alternate fuels which are greener and sustainable. Six different fuel blends were used for this study which was prepared by mixing different proportions of ethanol, methanol, butanol and gasoline. The purpose of mixing alcohols with gasoline is to reduce to consumption of gasoline. These blends have reported satisfactory engine performance and also burn greener. Alcohols have numerous advantages as fuels but they are polar and have high affinity towards moisture. This makes these alcohol–gasoline blends to be more corrosive in nature. The present study measures the corrosion rate of aluminium and mild steel (MS) using potentiodynamic polarization and impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical studies were performed using a three-electrode system. These techniques are much more rapid when compared to the traditional weight loss measurement techniques. Tafel plots directly give the corrosion current and corrosion rate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is also a reliable technique to determine corrosion rate and can accurately measure extremely small corrosion rate values even in a low-conducting alcohol–gasoline fuel blend environment. Of the two metals studied, MS was found to be prone to undergoing more corrosion. The results would be of great help to assess the compatibility of the metallic parts of the automobiles and of fuelling infrastructure materials with these alternate fuels. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.",Alcohol–gasoline blends; Compatibility studies; Corrosion rate; Impedance spectroscopy; Tafel curves,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nandakrishnan, M.H.; Centre for Incubation, India; email: meenaparam75@gmail.com",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,3666352,,CHPAE,,English,Chem.

Machine learning techniques can be used to predict the performance of WLANs with the vast training data obtained through contemporary network simulators. They are quite useful to predict the throughput in crowded and dynamic deployments of WLANs where hand-crafted solutions may not be feasible. This paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that can contribute to improving the performance of next-generation WLANs. In particular, we employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict the performance of Wi-Fi deployments by exploiting topology information and capturing complex wireless interactions. The network simulator, Komondor, is used to simulate different real-life scenarios for generating comprehensive datasets for training the model. Our approach addresses challenges related to energy efficiency, latency, and data rate in WLANs, and the regression model can be used to predict the throughput of a Basic Service Set (BSS) before it is deployed, allowing for better network design and optimization. The findings of this study demonstrated that GNNs can accurately forecast the throughput of BSSs in WLAN deployments in a given region with minimal information. Overall, our proposed approach can significantly influence the choice of topology for deployment, leading to optimal performance in crowded and dynamic WLAN scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.",Graph Neural Network (GNN); IEEE 802.11ac/ax; International Telecommunication Union (ITU) challenge; Komondor; next-generation Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs); Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS); performance prediction; throughput,,,"We are grateful to Francesc Wilhemi of Nokia Bell Labs, Germany, for helping us understand the Komondor software and supporting us at different stages.

One specialised branch of graph theory is mathematical chemistry, which focuses on mathematical modelling and analysing chemical compounds and their properties. In this context, graphs are used to represent the structural and topological features of molecules, enabling chemists to gain insights into chemical reactions and make predictions about molecular properties. Recently, new versions of Sombor indices have been introduced using a geometric approach. This article specifically focuses on entropy-based variations of these Sombor indices, which includes SO, (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.), in the context of graphene sheet. Graphene has gained significant attention in the scientific and technological communities due to its exceptional properties. It finds widespread applications in diverse fields such as nanotechnology, electronics, energy storage, sensors, materials science and optoelectronics. Given the promising applications of graphene, it becomes essential to theoretically analyse its structure.

However, popular music recommendation techniques today still fall short of adapting to each user and often, there is not much difference in the recommendations offered to users with substantially different personas. The root cause lies in the over-reliance on music metadata which may not sufficiently capture the auditory characteristics of the music. Ensongle, a novel music recommendation engine described in this paper, attempts to bridge this gap by representing a song with a customized embedding derived from both its mel-spectrogram which captures its raw audio content, as well as the song metadata. It also takes into account the user’s preference for a song by considering the number of times it has been played by the user. Graph neural networks can offer flexibility in terms of the way to model items being recommended and the users being served recommendations into a heterogeneous graph. Using one such heterogeneous graph along with graph neural network techniques, Ensongle proposes a radical upgrade by utilizing user and song features embedded in the graph as compared to random embeddings. On computing the Mean Average Recall on the test set for both the proposed approach and the approach with random embeddings, the former outperforms the latter by 36.67%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.",Heterogeneous graph convolutional network; Music recommendation; Song embeddings; User embeddings; Vectorisation,Audio acoustics; Customer satisfaction; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Metadata; Music; Convolutional networks; Embeddings; Graph neural networks; Heterogeneous graph; Heterogeneous graph convolutional network; Music recommendation; Song embedding; User embedding; Vectorization; Embeddings,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mysore, A.S.; Computer Science Engineering Department, Karnataka, India; email: aravindmsubramanya@gmail.com",Roy S.Sinwar D.Dey N.Perumal T.Tavares J.M.R.S.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

As compared to textual content, images are much more effective in communicating a message and compounding any intended emotional effect on the audience. Hence, the focus of this work is the emotion in the visual content of the disinformation campaigns. As the visuals in social media need not always carry a human face, the emotion conveyed by social media visuals is contextual emotion instead of emotion on isolated human faces. The work described in this paper makes two hypothesis, i.e. contextual emotion conveyed by social media visuals enhance the intended message and such contextual emotion in each type of disinformation carry some distinctive traits. To carry out this investigation, a visual image dataset has been manually curated for the three types of disinformation.

With technology stacks moving to the cloud, microservices-based architecture (MSA) is becoming increasingly common. MSA consists of small, modular, and loosely coupled services that communicate over the network via well-defined APIs. Although an MSA may significantly boost the speed and efficiency of software service delivery, it also makes systems more operationally complex. Service meshes have emerged as a viable solution to alleviate this problem by adding a dedicated infrastructure layer on top of the microservices architecture without altering the service implementations. We have performed a thorough measurement and examination of the overheads associated with deploying microservices in a service mesh using wrk2 for latency sensitivity analysis and Linux-perf for microarchitectural analysis. We present a comprehensive overview of the overheads in terms of CPU cycles, system instructions, page faults, and cache misses in deploying a state-of-the-art service mesh (Istio) on a Kubernetes cluster running a benchmark microservices application (Death-StarBench). © 2023 IEEE.",Cloud computing; Empirical analysis; Istio; Microarchitectural analysis; Microservices; Service meshes,Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Mesh generation; Network architecture; Analysis and characterization; Cloud-computing; Empirical analysis; High quality service; Istio; Micro-architectural analysis; Microservice; Performance; Service mesh; Technology landscapes; Sensitivity analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Asian Conf.

Woven fabrics are made by interlacement of warp and weft which are made up of two set of yarns with the longitudinal / lengthwise / vertical set of yarns called warp and horizontal / transverse set of yarns called as weft. Number of threads per inch of warp and weft determine the compactness of a fabric and weight of fabric. A lot of research is in progress towards automating the warp and weft threads in linear distance measurement with most of them using pre-recorded images. In this paper, design and evaluation of a real-time warp and weft measurement system for textile testing using computer vision and machine learning algorithms is proposed. The machine learning algorithm employed for proposed work is an unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm. The performance of proposed system is evaluated on two types of silk sarees, with and without identical warp and weft yarn colour in the saree. The proposed system costs only 32 with an overall response time varying between 1.42-3.09s based on the type of saree and hardware used.

The input signal is decomposed into its constituent frequencies and its frequency and phase are derived. The analytical signal of the input signal is calculated to obtain its amplitude envelope. The reconstructed audio signal is determined as a sinusoidal wave by using the extracted components.

The agility of the proposed method is determined using different types of instruments viz. Guitar, Sitar, Saxophone, and Flute. The simulated audio signals of the proposed approach are found to have higher SNR values than the original signals along with good perceptual quality and minimal RMSE and good PSNR values.

Rapid urbanization, poor infrastructure, and insufficient traffic management systems are frequently blamed for these problems. An intelligent Traffic system is essential to solve these issues and improve the effectiveness, and sustainability of transportation systems. This investigation aims to perform an in-depth network analysis using the case of Bengaluru, an urban city of India, utilizing graph analytics techniques. Centrality measures are used to identify critical nodes and road segments that critically contribute to traffic congestion. Further, Community detection algorithms uncover clusters of areas with similar traffic patterns and congestion hotspots. Lastly, link prediction methods forecast future traffic flows and indicate potential bottlenecks. The research findings provide data-driven insights and recommendations for improving the efficiency and sustainability of transportation in Bengaluru. The findings of this study can go beyond Bengaluru, serving as a valuable resource for those making decisions, transportation organizations, and urban planners in quickly expanding urban areas with comparable transportation difficulties. © 2023 IEEE.",Centrality Measures; Community detection; Graph Analytics; Intelligent Traffic systems; Link Prediction; Traffic analysis,Forecasting; Population dynamics; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Analytic approach; Centrality measures; Community detection; Graph-analytic; Intelligent traffic systems; Link prediction; Sustainable transportation; Traffic analysis; Transportation network; Urban transportation networks; Sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Only a small percentage of them are helpful to people. However, most of them are harmful to people and can lead to fatal illnesses. Hence timely identification and taking necessary action is very important. Therefore, it's important to identify them quickly and take the appropriate steps to stop them. The first step in this would be the identification and classification of bacteria. Traditional or manual methods for classification include gram staining, motility testing, biochemical testing, and so on. But these methods are time-consuming and also require human expertise along with long training time to train the operators. Additionally, with the advancements in technology, a system for the automatic classification of bacteria can be developed using machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we aim in developing a system that uses machine learning techniques to create a system for automatically classifying bacteria, cutting down on the time required for the human procedure. As CNN is proven to be highly efficient for working with images, we are employing CNN for image processing. But due to the requirement of larger number of images for CNN training we are using a hybrid approach. Random Forest has been employed along with CNN for efficient classification. The system proved to be efficient with an accuracy of 98%. The inclusion of Artificial Intelligence is greatly assisting microbiologists, the food industry, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and many more. © 2023 IEEE.",Bacterial classification; Convolutional neural network; Deep Learning; Random Forest,Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Food processing; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Personnel training; Bacterial classifications; Biochemical testing; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Gram-staining; Hybrid approach; Living things; Manual methods; Random forests; Timely identification; Bacteria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

The 3-source model uses verified data along with data from users to build an understanding of the Tulu language. It implements a modified Hidden Markov model to weigh Part Of Speech (POS) sequences to decide which sequences are yet to be understood or which sentences are more likely. Past attempts to build models for low-resource languages have mainly attempted to use similar languages which are high-resource, or else used rule-based translation. These have a moderate amount of success with regards to accuracy when compared against high-resource models. Efforts to combine the two methods have also been made. A combination of a limited database, user inputs, and community feedback is employed in the 3-source model to create a language model. This model can be replicable for other languages. The project has three intended outcomes: one, to develop a dataset for Tulu words and sentences in a usable format; two, to be able to generate and translate sentences which are accurate in terms of syntax and semantics; and three, to be able to infer results from user feedback and improve its understanding of Tulu. Possible applications of the system include preserving languages having small communities, document translation, language learning applications, and simplifying error correction in translation.

The bacterium possesses unique resistance to several antibiotics. Numerous resistance mechanisms like reliable efflux pumps, reduced permeability of the cell membrane, inactivation of antimicrobial drugs by enzymatic mechanisms and modification of antibiotic target sites enable the survival of the bacteria in adverse conditions. The causes and extent of antibiotic resistance in this bacterial species have been elucidated clearly. The ability of the pathogen to express several mutations in crucial genes makes it lethal. The everlasting threat of intrinsic as well as acquired antimicrobial resistance in common bacterial species is studied extensively to devise newer and effective therapeutics for the general public. Several studies have worked on the methods to deal with P. aeruginosa infections.

These approaches have proved to provide much more accurate and reliable results compared to traditional/conventional approaches to forecasting like Simple Regression and Multi Regression. Deep Learning models like LSTM which are based on the concept of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are usually said to produce more accurate forecasts. The prophet algorithm was introduced by Facebook in 2017 for building forecasting models for time series data. The question which arises is that whether the Prophet algorithm can produce forecasts with greater accuracy when compared to models such as LSTM which have been in use for decades. The accuracy of the forecast may also depend on the dataset used in order the implement the models. In order to contribute to devising the solution for this, this paper compares the forecasting accuracy of these popular models using multiple data sets. © 2023 IEEE.",Prophet; Recurrent Neural Networks; Regression,Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Regression analysis; Time series; Forecasting time series; Learning-based algorithms; Machine-learning; On-machines; Predictive power; Prophet; Regression; Retail sales; Sales forecasting; Time-series data; Sales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

Despite this, due to its algorithmic design of combining or mixing of 'styles', there has so far been no way of definitively controlling the output of the images/faces produced by a trained StyleGAN model. In this paper, the proposed approach is, to control the sizes of facial features in the images generated by StyleGAN2 by feeding curated image data (produced via the discussed data pre-processing method) to the GAN model. The said data preprocessing approach comprises facial-feature size-ratio calculation, data discretization through binning and a unique querying approach. Testing has been performed to check whether the approach improves the quality of output images produced either in terms of metrics like FID/KID or in terms of time-efficiency by comparing the curated based training output to its non-curated counterpart. The generated output is also subjected to a verification process to estimate the levels of control obtained over the sizes of the facial features of generated images. It was found that the proposed data preprocessing methodology helps manipulate facial feature sizes in at most 70% of the generated images (based on sample testing). It is to be noted that these values were achieved using relatively primitive methods of image discretization and also with the GAN system being trained on dataset sizes which were smaller than recommended. © 2023 IEEE.",Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (ADA); Data Curation; Data Querying; Deep Learning; FID; Image Generation; KID; StyleGAN2,Data handling; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Adaptive discriminator augmentation; Data curation; Data preprocessing; Data querying; Deep learning; Facial feature; FID; Image generations; KID; Stylegan2; Discriminators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annu.

This formulation modeled variable length sequences in a M-ary Hopfield network in the form of multiple variable length limit cycles. In the current paper, we extend this limit cycle formulation and propose a novel ‘connectionist temporal sequence decoding’ algorithm to solve the generic ‘temporal sequence decoding’ problem (which is the central decoding process in sequence-to-sequence learning tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), movie scene recognition (MSR) etc.). Here, we model multiple prototype movie sub-sequences (scenes) of variable lengths from a given vocabulary as multiple limit cycles of a single MHNN of size 10000 neurons (and 100 million interconnection weights) and apply the proposed decoding algorithm. The proposed algorithm, uses the trained MHNN model along with Hopfield energy based End-of-Sequence markers to decode a very long noisy movie scene (comprising sub-sequence scenes with non-linear temporal and statistical variability). The proposed method solves the movie scene segmentation and labelling task with zero error. We note that this is a first of its kind solution in associative-memory based formulation using multi-level multi-limit cycle Hopfield networks for realization of such a ‘connectionist temporal sequence decoding’, representing a pleasing solution with biological-realism for such sequence decoding problems, which are conventionally solved by dynamic programming frameworks such as Viterbi decoding and finite-state networks in ASR kind of problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Connectionist temporal sequence decoding; Dual-Weight learning; M-ary Hopfield neural-network; Multi-limit cycle; Two-Stage firing,Associative processing; Associative storage; Dynamic programming; Hopfield neural networks; Memory architecture; Motion pictures; Speech recognition; Connectionist temporal sequence decoding; Dual weights; Dual-weight learning; Limit-cycle; M-ary hopfield neural-network; Multi-limit cycle; Multilevels; Temporal sequences; Two-stage firing; Variable length; Decoding,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ladwani, V.M.; International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B)India; email: vandana.ladwani@iiitb.ac.in",Iliadis L.Papaleonidas A.Angelov P.Jayne C.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,3029743,9.78303E+12,,,English,Lect.

The decision for routing is made based on a weighted heuristic. The proposed algorithm, QLEN aims to improve three quality of service factors, namely L (load balancing efficiency), E (energy consumption) and N (network usage); hence the name QLEN. The importance of these parameters can be varied according to the application. This is done by adjusting the weights to suit the needs of the incoming tasks. For the default use case, the weights are tuned for the optimization of all three of the parameters. These optimal weights are calculated using stochastic gradient descent. QLEN is compared against fundamental load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, Throttled Round Robin and Priority Based Load Balancing algorithm. The environment simulates a health monitoring application, using the iFogSim simulator. The results show that QLEN consistently outperforms the compared algorithms with respect to the targeted parameters. The efficiency of load distribution achieved by QLEN on average performs 1.69% better than all the three algorithms; at the same time showing 54.86% lesser network usage, 3413.33 MJ lesser energy consumption and 10.39% reduced redirection to the cloud. The algorithm also scales efficiently, showing better performance as the number of fog devices increases. © 2023 IEEE.",energy consumption; FCN; fog computing; FON; iFogSim; load balancer; load balancing efficiency; network usage; QLEN,Balancing; Electric power plant loads; Energy efficiency; Fog; Fog computing; Gradient methods; Green computing; Optimization; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Stochastic systems; Energy-consumption; FCN; FON; Ifogsim; Load balancer; Load balancing efficiency; Load distributions; Load-Balancing; Network usage; QLEN; Energy utilization,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hegde, P.R.; Pes University, India; email: pranavhegde06@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Cross-site scripting attack is one such threat to web applications. Cross-site scripting also known as XSS is an attack wherein a malicious code is injected into a web application which leads to compromise of user data. One of the biggest effects of XSS is that it can lead to exposing user's credentials and data. So this paper discusses an approach to mitigate the attack by using a dual-layered defence mechanism. In the first defence layer, a KNN model is used to prevent any attacker from injecting XSS scripts into the application, if the model fails to prevent this attack in the first layer, then a second layer of defence is used which uses a session mapping method where the user's session is mapped with the user's system details, these details include IP, OS and browser, so if the attacker tries to log in to the application with the victim's session and if the system details don't match, then the attacker will be restricted from accessing the application. With this dual-layered defence mechanism in the application, it is very hard for an attacker to access a victim's account. © 2023 IEEE.",machine learning; malicious; prevention; session; token; web application; XSS,Defence mechanisms; Machine-learning; Malicious; Prevention; Security risks; Session; Token; WEB application; Web applications; XSS; Machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anchan, A.D.; Pes University, India",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

The user-provided text can be instantly transformed into a realistic image with the aid of generative neural architectures. This study intends to propose a novel approach to generate a facial image based on a user-given textual description. Prior works focus less on the manipulation aspects, hence the approach also emphasizes on manipulating and modifying the image generated, based on additional textual descriptions as required to further refine the expected face. It consists of a multi-level Vector-Quantized Variational Auto Encoder (VQVAE) that provides the image encodings, the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) module to interpret the texts and compute how close the final image encodings and the text are with each other within a common space, and a StyleGAN2 to decode and generate the required image output. The combination of such components within the architecture is unseen in previous studies and yields promising results, capturing the context of the text and generating realistic good quality images of human faces. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP); Facial synthesis; Image manipulation; StyleGAN2; Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQVAE),Encoding (symbols); Image processing; Learning systems; Signal encoding; Auto encoders; Contrastive language image pre-training; Facial Image synthesis; Facial synthesis; Image encoding; Image manipulation; Pre-training; Stylegan2; Textual description; Vector quantized variational autoencoder; Vector spaces,,,,,,,,,,,,"Srinivasa, A.; PES University, Karnataka, India; email: anagha190601@gmail.com",Rutkowski L.Scherer R.Korytkowski M.Pedrycz W.Tadeusiewicz R.Zurada J.M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,3029743,9.78303E+12,,,English,Lect.

These platforms sometimes act as a bane for society as they have led to the rapid propagation of hatred. Therefore, Hate Speech Detection and Classification is a crucial task for moderators of these platforms, so that appropriate actions are taken against the offenders and make the Internet a safe place for all humans. This work proposes a two-step novel approach that detects online content as “Hate” or “Non-hate” speech in the first step and then subclassifies hate speech as “Racist”, “Sexist” or “Neither”. For rigorous testing of the trained models, a testing dataset was created by scrapping tweets about the controversial topic “#NupurSharma” from Twitter.

Several abnormalities including hernia, tumour, and neuro-muscular diseases can be identified and estimated by CT scans, including the representation of muscle loss. Radiologists carefully segment and review every CT slice to monitor these abnormalities. This is a meticulous, painstaking, and time-consuming process. This is especially true for the abdomen, which has a lot of variations and complexities in the wall and surrounding tissues. To solve this, we annotated 451 image-mask pairs from DICOM files of the abdominal muscles of size $$512 \times 512$$ pixels. In this work, the trade-off between computation cost and image loss is estimated by splitting the imageries into two categories of size: $$128 \times 128$$ pixels and $$512 \times 512$$ pixels. To sustain the original image size, the authors create a resized version of the base U-Net and train it from scratch. Furthermore, two dataset categories are created to show the data-intensive quality of the models (One double in size compared to the other). To train the system using these datasets, two architectures U-Net and resized U-Net are used which are then compared through the introduction of a new loss function—“complete loss”. The resized U-Net performs better than the standard U-Net by displaying a mean complete loss of 3.52 and 10.79% for the validation and test sets, respectively. The data dependency of models is clearly shown as well. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Computed tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Fully convolutional network; Semantic segmentation; U-Net,Computerized tomography; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Economic and social effects; Network architecture; Pixels; Semantic Web; Semantics; Abdominal muscle; Computed tomography; Computed tomography scan; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Data set size; Fully convolutional network; Modeling architecture; Semantic segmentation; U-net; Semantic Segmentation,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bisleri, A.P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: ankitpb1234@gmail.com",Ranganathan G.Papakostas G.A.Rocha A.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

This paper focuses on using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to detect natural disasters. Previously, many attempts have been made to detect natural disasters using different techniques including the use of sensors, satellites, drones, crowdsourcing, and basic ML models and reducing the severity of these disasters. But natural disaster detection still faces challenges due to the limitations of the above techniques like high cost of equipment and training time, lower accuracy, etc. Therefore, in order to combat these issues, transfer learning models are being used, namely a few architectures from VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet. Many different values for epochs and dataset sizes were experimented with, as well as different configurations for the hidden layers and optimizers to improve the classification accuracy. From the results obtained after training the models, ResNet50 gave the best results with an accuracy of 96.35%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Image classification; Natural disaster detection; ResNet; Transfer learning,Classification (of information); Computer vision; Deep learning; Disasters; Drones; Learning systems; Losses; Economic loss; Images classification; Loss of life; Machine-learning; Natural disaster detection; Natural disasters; Property; Resnet; Sensor satellites; Transfer learning; Image classification,,,,,,,,,,,,"Srinivas, L.T.; PES UniversityIndia; email: lohith.srinivas.t@gmail.com",Ranganathan G.Papakostas G.A.Rocha A.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

Various models are already proposed by researchers, to recognize handwritten text and convert it into a plain text/paragraph, they failed to retain positions of the original text. This paper focuses on developing a machine learning model to process an image of handwritten text and convert it into a digitized text, which indeed retains the position. The proposed model in this paper makes use of long short-term memory (LSTM) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, which forms a basic cell for the bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that helps in the classification of various characters given in the input image. To predict and map these classified characters accordingly, the model uses connectionist temporal classification (CTC) that decodes the RNN output matrix, which indeed predicts multiple possible labels for each time-step. This model makes use of word beam search (WBS) which is one of the type under CTC algorithm, WBS is used for decoding the output layer as it yields the most accurate result with least character error rate (CER) 6.66% that is better than the earlier acquired results.

The customer won’t have to spend a lot of time looking for stuff they could enjoy if movie suggestions are provided. To get user-specific movie suggestions, a recommendation system for movies is also essential. It has been discovered, after conducting extensive online research and consulting a large number of research papers, that the suggestions produced utilising Content-based filtering in order to compare the similarity of the vectors, filtering only employs a single method for text-to-vector conversion. To produce the final recommendation list for this study, the output of various text-to-vector conversion algorithms was altered and employed a variety of text-to-vector conversion strategies. It solely employs the content-based filtering technique, although it may be thought as a hybrid strategy. With the help of movie recommendation systems that employ content-based filtering, these systems can suggest a movie to the viewer depending on the content. People now use movies as a getaway from their hectic life. A big dataset of movies that are accessible globally makes it difficult to pick just one movie, making watching movies more difficult than it has to be. In this work, Heroku deployment has been used to create a recommendation system that used a content-based filtering method. The most common methods for creating recommendation systems are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

These decisions have significant implications including, most importantly, the economic well-being of the farmers. In this paper, our objective is to accurately predict crop prices using historical price information, climate conditions, soil type, location, and other key determinants of crop prices. This is a technically challenging problem, which has been attempted before. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning based approach to achieve increased accuracy in price prediction. The proposed approach uses graph neural networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) model to exploit geospatial dependencies in prices. Our approach works well with noisy legacy data and produces a performance that is at least 20 % better than the results available in the literature. We are able to predict prices up to 30 days ahead.

Hand gesture interface has been becoming an active topic of human-computer interaction (HCI). The utilization of hand gestures in human-computer interface enables human operators to interact with computer environments in a natural and intuitive manner. In particular, bare hand interpretation technique frees users from cumbersome, but typically required devices in communication with computers, thus offering the ease and naturalness in HCI. Meanwhile, virtual assembly (VA) applies virtual reality (VR) techniques in mechanical assembly. It constructs computer tools to help product engineers planning, evaluating, optimizing, and verifying the assembly of mechanical systems without the need of physical objects. However, traditional devices such as keyboards and mice are no longer adequate due to their inefficiency in handling three-dimensional (3D) tasks. Special VR devices, such as data gloves, have been mandatory in VA. This project proposes a novel hand tracking interface for the application of VA. It develops a hybrid approach to incorporate an appearance-based hand localization technique with a skin tone filter in support of hand tracking in the 3D space. With this interface, bare hands become a convenient substitution of special VR devices. Experiment results demonstrate the flexibility and robustness introduced by the proposed method to HCI.

LC filters are used to obtain pure sinusoidal output. The proposed inverter focuses on reducing the number of switches used to obtain seven level output which in turn will reduce the number of gate driver circuits required for driving the mosfets. Simulation of the inverter is carried out in MATLAB Simulink. Hardware Model of this inverter circuit is been designed for 24V and the output of the inverter is used to run motor load. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.",Gate driver circuit; Multilevel Inverters; Power mosfet; Pulse Width Modulation; renewable resources,Electric inverters; Electric loads; MATLAB; Power MOSFET; Smart power grids; Timing circuits; Gate driver circuit; Inverter circuit; MOS-FET; Multilevel inverter; Multilevels; Power Mosfets; Pulsewidth modulations (PWM); Reduced switch; Renewable resource; Seven-level; Pulse width modulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stephen J.Sharma P.Chaba Y.Abraham K.U.Anooj P.K.Mohammad N.Thomas G.Srikiran S.,Grenze Scientific Society,,,,,English,"Int.

Our research paper approaches on how we can monitor our health at any place and any point of time. With an improvement in technology and miniaturization of sensors, there have been attempts to utilize the new technology in various areas to improve the quality of human life. One main area of research that has seen an adoption of the technology is the healthcare sector. As a result, this project is an attempt to solve a healthcare problem currently society is facing. The main objective of the project was to design a remote healthcare system. It’s comprised of three main parts. The first part being, detection of patient’s vitals using sensors, second for sending data to cloud storage and the last part was providing the detected data for remote viewing. Remote viewing of the data enables a doctor or guardian to monitor a patient’s health progress away from hospital premises. The Internet of Things (IoT) concepts have been widely used to interconnect the available medical resources and offer smart, reliable, and effective healthcare service to the patients. Health monitoring for active and assisted living is one of the paradigms that can use the IoT advantages to improve the patient’s lifestyle. In this project, we have presented an IoT architecture customized for healthcare applications. The aim of the project was to come up with a Remote Health Monitoring System that can be made with locally available sensors with a view to making it affordable if it were to be mass produced. Hence the proposed architecture collects the sensor data through ESP8266 microcontroller and relays it to the cloud where it is processed and analysed for remote viewing. The work presented in this paper is the mini-project work of the under-graduate students of the engineering college guided by their supervisors. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.",ESP8266 microcontroller; Health monitoring system; Internet of Things,Biomedical engineering; Digital storage; Health care; Microcontrollers; Students; Design and Development; Engineering applications; Esp8266 microcontroller; Health monitoring system; Healthcare sectors; Human health; Human lives; Miniaturisation; Remote viewing; Research papers; Internet of things,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stephen J.Sharma P.Chaba Y.Abraham K.U.Anooj P.K.Mohammad N.Thomas G.Srikiran S.,Grenze Scientific Society,,,,,English,"Int.

It is used as a substitute to the bulk material for example silicon or copper indium gallium selenide. Researchers have proven that nanotechnology may considerably increase the amount of electricity generated by solar cells. On altering the size of the quantum dots, a wide variety of energy levels can be observed with different bandgaps. Further, in CQD devices, the electron transport layer-ETL and hole transport layer-HTL plays a vital role in enhancing the performance. Maximum power conversion efficiency is achieved in this work by treating the HTL (PbS-EDT) with the absorber layer (PbS-TBAI) and ETL(TiO2). In the initial simulation, efficiency obtained is 9.88%. After altering the thickness of the absorber layer from 200 to 600 nm, the optimum result is obtained at 600 nm.

Protein functions are better understandable once their structures are known. Structure determination being arduous and expensive, computational techniques are finding their way over them. Determining the sequences which have invariant configurations of protein fragments, compiling them in a database and predicting the protein structures of determined and yet to be determined is goal of this research. From existing twenty amino acids, a database was developed that contains all the sequences of invariant protein fragment configurations by extracting the structural information of these sequences from known protein databases. Fragments size can go from minimum 3 to maximum 41. Invariant fragments are inflexible and rigid in structure three dimensionally. Varied length fragments obtained from structures considered were superimposed to get Root Mean Square Deviation values (RMSD). Statistical analysis, skewness and kurtosis cut-off decided the fragments as variant and invariant ones, then invariant fragments were analysed by Brute Force method for prediction. This article explored the essence of determination and prediction techniques, to come up with one of the novel solutions for tertiary structure prediction. The purpose is to explore the possibility of predicting protein structure from this invariant protein fragment library. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.",Brute Force; Building block; Determination; Prediction; Protein; RMSD-Root Mean Square Deviation,Database systems; Forecasting; Higher order statistics; Brute force; Building blockes; Determination; Power; Protein fragments; Protein tertiary structure prediction; Proteins structures; Root mean square deviation value-root mean square deviation; Root-mean-square deviations; Proteins,,"The authors would like to acknowledge the management and staff of PES University, the librarian, Dr Subhash Reddy of PES University and whole heartedly acknowledge C-DAC Knowledge Park, (Old Madras Road, Byppanahalli) Bengaluru, for providing supercomputing facilities for the research work.",,,,,,,,,,,Stephen J.Sharma P.Chaba Y.Abraham K.U.Anooj P.K.Mohammad N.Thomas G.Srikiran S.,Grenze Scientific Society,,,,,English,"Int.

The solution of the constructed problem is heeded by a pdepe solver in Matlab, which works on the centered-finite difference technique. Darcy’s model is utilized to investigate porous nature. A stretching/shrinking mechanism has been incorporated to improve the fin efficiency. Stretching reduces efficiency, whereas shrinking improves fin efficiency indicating major benefits of fin design consideration. The relevant temperature results are shown visually and discussed quantitatively in detail to evaluate the competence of the suggested fin. With a rise in the Peclet number, temperature distribution decreases. A similar nature is noted with respect to the power index of convective heat transfer coefficient, convection and radiation parameters, porous parameter, stretching/shrinking parameter, and thermal conductivity gradient with temperature. The graphical outcomes also show that the fin temperature amplifies with the ambient temperature parameter. Also, it is noticed that thermal distribution is a decreasing function of the power index of the convective heat transfer coefficient such that there is a decrease of 1.64% in temperature distribution as the power index increases. To support the validity of the solutions, a comparison was made with notable results from the existing literature for the specific case of this study. The novelty of the work is to study highly nonlinear boundary value problems and such nonlinearities are more relevant in the system that describes the thermal processing of materials. It is also noted that initial transient heat transfer vanishes quickly under steady-state conditions when the material is exposed to the ambient temperature. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Fin tip temperature; heat transfer; moving porous fin; numerical analysis; stretching/shrinking; thermal conductivity; trapezoidal profiled fin,Boundary value problems; Fins (heat exchange); Heat convection; Heat transfer coefficients; Temperature distribution; Thermal conductivity; 'current; Convective heat transfer; Fin efficiency; Fin tip temperature; Heat transfer co-efficients; Moving porous fin; Power indices; Stretching/shrinking; Transient heat transfer; Trapezoidal profiled fin; Efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madhura, K.R.; Post Graduate Department of Mathematics, Karnataka, India; email: madhurakrmadhu@gmail.com",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,10407790,,NHBFE,,English,Numer Heat Transfer Part B Fundam,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174319803,,,,,,,

We were able to extract some helpful algorithms and strategies from the research papers that we might apply in our future work to improve accuracy and navigate challenges. These include yawning, face detection, head movements, entity detection, and blinking. However, because accurate and robust algorithms are required, developing a dependable and effective sleepiness detection system is a challenging task. The identification of driver distraction and sleepiness has been studied using a variety of techniques in the past. To evaluate how successfully these algorithms recognise drowsiness in light of the recent advancement of deep learning, modifications to these algorithms are necessary.

A few of them are event costs, vote tampering, fake vote casting, etc. To handle the challenges, technological intervention can be a great potential in transforming the scenario. There will be no need to print ballot papers or set up polling stations—voters can vote from anywhere with internet access. Even though using the electronic mode, we have to face problems like maintenance and reliability. In the proposed method, using blockchain technology and adopting new protocols we can enable the system to be resilient to vulnerabilities and at the same time solve the purpose.

The present research focuses on mixed convective hydromagnetic electrically conducting fluid flow in a vertical annulus using thermodynamic concepts, in the presence of induced magnetic field along with entropy generation and time periodic boundary conditions. The governing equations related to the present model are solved using finite element method. Also to predict heat transport features in the vertical annulus, artificial neural network–backpropogated Levenberg Marquardt algorithm is adopted. The steady and periodic profiles of velocity, skin friction, temperature and induced magnetic field are illustrated graphically for specific range of pertinent parameters to demonstrate significant aspects of the results. It is noted that increase in Hartmann number enhances the entropy generation near the outer cylinder, which illustrates that the fluid friction and magnetic field influence is maximum at the outer cylinder surface. The Bejan number in the annulus reduces with increase in viscous heating parameter. Results indicate that raise in the Prandtl number diminishes the thermal boundary layer thickness. As a result of decrease in the intensity of heating the boundary walls, a raise in Strouhal number lowers the fluid temperature profile.

After performing molecular docking, the consideration of vina score in filtering the compounds without collecting the hydrogen bond or hydrophobic interaction between protein and ligand complex leads to missing multiple good lead molecules. The tools used for virtual screening in drug design and discovery studies were previously designed and developed for small datasets. LigPlots were used to generate 2-dimensional (2D) interaction maps of protein-ligand complexes. These maps depict diverse bonds like hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions in varied colors for all ligand conformations within the library. However, handling large numbers of protein-ligand complexes can make this process quite laborious. The development of a tool is strongly required or an implementation of automation to generate all the interaction details has a strong demand. This paper describes an implementation of an automation technique on the executable programs like ligplot.exe, hbplus.exe and hbadd.exe to obtain the 2D interaction map (LigPlots) of the protein and ligand complex (*.ps) and hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in *.csv format for molecules to be considered for virtual screening by using some sorting & searching algorithms and python’s file handling functions, and it also mentions the program’s limitations and availability of the program.

If there are multiple earthquakes in any of the year, the performance of structure assessed from linear elastic analysis is not sufficient therefore there is a need of study on non-linear behavior of the structure to provide an extra safety to the structures. The nonlinear dynamic analysis needs lot of data to be given to the generated model in software for studying the behavior of the structure but there is another promising method to overcome the above complexity that is nonlinear static analysis (Pushover analysis) to the assess the behavior of the structure when subjected to multiple earthquakes. For the present study, A G+6 Story 'L' Shape plan irregular steel structure (model 1) with floor to floor height as 3 m and 7 bays in 'X' & 'Y' direction of each 4 m is considered. From Pushover analysis on 'L' shape steel structure, it was observed that some of corner columns reached capacity ratio due to excessive stress at beam-column junction and to overcome this, the retrofitting technique was adopted that is consideration of those corners columns as composite columns in the same steel structure (model 2). The plastic hinges formed due to PUSHX for model 1 have reached immediate occupancy performance level to life safety performance level but at 9th iteration, 8 numbers of plastic hinges have been formed in Collapse presentation level hence there might be partial or complete collapse of structure. After retrofitting model 1, the plastic hinges in greater than CP level were formed in different step number so therefore, model 2 sustains more damage before it collapse. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Accurate classification and monitoring of these species can aid in understanding their distribution, population dynamics, and the impact of human activities on them. However, classifying marine species can be challenging due to their vast diversity and the complex underwater environment. With advancements in computer performance and GPU-based computing, deep-learning algorithms can now efficiently classify marine species, making it easier to monitor and manage marine ecosystems. In this paper, we propose an optimization to the MobileNetV2 model to achieve a 99.83% average validation accuracy by highlighting specific guidelines for creating a dataset and augmenting marine species images. This transfer learning algorithm can be deployed successfully on a mobile application for on-site classification at fisheries. © 2023 IEEE.",Classification; Dataset Augmentation; Deep Learning; Marine; Mobile Application; MobileNetV2; Transfer Learning,Climate change; Deep learning; E-learning; Ecosystems; Health risks; Learning algorithms; Marine pollution; Mobile computing; Dataset augmentation; Deep learning; Distribution populations; Human activities; Marine; Marine species; Mobile applications; Mobilenetv2; Species classification; Transfer learning; Classification (of information),,,,,,,,,,,,"Dey, K.; Pes University, India; email: deykohav@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"OCEANS - Limerick, OCEANS Limerick",Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85173682758,,,,,,,

It is a crucial task for administrators to extract useful information from logs. Analysis of these logs is essential to find anomalies and fix issues quickly in the application/service. It is a very tedious task to go through all the log messages manually to find anomalies. This points to the need for an anomaly detection system. An anomaly detection system automates the analysis of logs generated by the system to discover abnormalities in the system execution. To build the anomaly detection system, three deep learning models i.e. LSTM (Long short-term memory), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and CNN (Convolutional neural network) is proposed. Ensemble of these three models using the voting technique is built. The ensemble of deep learning models is done to arrive at an optimal prediction for anomalies as these models compensate for the drawbacks of each other. This paper also talks about the implementation of real-time anomaly detection by leveraging the existing bulk log parser called Drain to do online parsing. A user interface is provided to view the detected anomalies and filter the logs accordingly. © 2023 IEEE.",Anomaly detection; BERT; CNN; Ensemble; Logs; LSTM,Convolutional neural networks; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; User interfaces; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection systems; Application services; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Convolutional neural network; Ensemble; Learning models; Log; Real- time; Time log; Anomaly detection,,,,,,,,,,,,"Puranik, A.; Pes University, India; email: abhiramkpuranik@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

This is achieved by the agent receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions. In this study, we compare the performance of two RL algorithms, SARSA and Q-Learning, in a simulated environment using the Gazebo Simulator. The goal of the simulation is to navigate a ground robot towards pre-defined goals. By manipulating various training parameters, we investigate the impact on learning speed and robot behavior. To ensure meaningful comparisons, we vary the navigation goal and the complexity of the simulation environment. Through extensive simulations, our results highlight the effectiveness of RL-based navigation for ground robots and offer insights into the influential parameters that significantly affect optimal navigation performance.

On the other hand, emerging countries have traditionally beencriticised for increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Asia is the largest continent and also represents the largest conglomerate of developing countries. In this scenario, it becomes important to investigate the relevance of the digital economy in promoting a pro-environment system. Furthermore, it is also important to verify the appropriateness of the anthropocentric approach to sustainable development and resilience in attaining inclusive sustainable development in the background of Asia. In 1983, the Brundtland Commission report coined ‘sustainable development’ and published following its dissolution in 1987. The commission noted the environmental decline that has beenhappening over centuries through anthropogenic activities. This chapter examines how the digital economy, the much-perceived greensector, might boost Asian environmental resilience. A panel data regression analysis is used to examine whether the digital economy can improve environmental resilience and add to development's sustainability aspects.

Conventional algorithms are not adequate to address issues with the cloud, including uneven task distribution in virtual machines or inefficient resource delivery to cloud customers. To significantly enhance the outcome of cloud apps and address the aforementioned difficulties, it is necessary to investigate further sophisticated ways. This study looks into the most recent machine learning techniques that can handle the difficulties in a cloud context. A paradigm monitoring and identification of errors in Virtual Machine (VM) resource utilization is put forth in this study. The suggested methodology called IF-SVM (Isolation Forest-Support Vector Machine) is able to identify the errors. The VM workload trace from PlanetLab is used to test and train the samples. During this process, the concepts of ML techniques such as SVM and IF and the VM resource matrix is used. F1-score of 0.87 is able to achieve by using the SVM for the time series of 1 h and 0.91 F1-score for Isolation Forest for the 50 VMs. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of both methods for the model, but SVM outperforms well in terms of classification in comparison with Isolation Forest. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.",Cloud computing; Isolation forest (IF); Support vector machine (SVM); Virtual machine (VM),,,,,,,,,,,,,"Priyanka, H.; PES UniversityIndia; email: priyankahsachin@gmail.com",,Springer,21953988,,,,English,Cogn.

The first DNN is designed to obtain an optimal beamforming weight vector which maximizes the achievable rate over the IRS-aided network. The beamforming vector is designed based on a pilot-based channel estimation procedure, which requires only a small fraction of the available reflecting surfaces on the IRS to be active. The obtained vector is fed to the second DNN, which is designed for detecting information symbols from the transmitter. Our simulation study shows that the achievable rate obtained using the designed beamforming vector approaches the maximum achievable rate quickly, as the number of active elements increases. Further, we compute the computational complexities of the proposed architectures.

Improvement in the performance of sorting is achievable through hardware acceleration either in FPGA or ASIC. The performance improvement and reduction in power consumption are the goals of researchers implementing sorting algorithms on hardware. The Multi-Dimensional Sorting Algorithm (MDSA) improves the basic Bitonic sorting implementation to find the largest and smallest records at any time throughout the sorting process. In this work, we extend the MDSA for Hybrid and Odd-Even sorters while we also optimize the MDSA sorter architectures for low power using clock gating and index sorting techniques. We present the different MDSA sorter topologies and their low power versions with comparative results. The saed90nm standard cell library was used for implementation and analysis.

The network comprises of a JRC-equipped base station (BS), an IRS module, a radar target, and a communication user. We calculate the optimal beamforming matrix from the BS, by formulating a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the SNR at the BS due to the target, such that a minimum rate at the user is maintained. For a given IRS weight matrix, the solution to this convex problem is obtained using the bisection search algorithm. Next, the radar performance is evaluated using supervised support vector machine-based learning, in terms of probability of detection. Furthermore, the communication performance at the user is evaluated through the capacity of the link. The effect of number of reflecting elements in IRS on the radar and communication performances is studied, and it is shown that the presence of IRS yields a significant performance improvement in the JRC system. © 2023 IEEE.",Bisection search method; channel capacity; intelligent reflecting surfaces; joint radar and communication systems; support vector machines,Constrained optimization; Matrix algebra; Signal to noise ratio; Bisection search; Bisection search method; Channel's capacity; Communications systems; Intelligent reflecting surface; Joint radar and communication system; Radar performance; Reflecting surface; Search method; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akshay, K.G.; Pes University, India; email: akki.642002@gmai1.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc.

A popular method is the Gaussian scale space analysis which limits the performance by smoothing both the noise and natural boundaries in the same proportion. In order to prevent the loss of natural boundaries to smoothing we tap into nonlinear scale space techniques such as KAZE and Accelerated KAZE. KAZE is a multistage 2-D feature detection and description algorithm. It makes use of AOS schemes to develop the nonlinear scale space for analysis. Though the results are satisfactory, it is computationally intense as they solve a humongous module of linear equations. To ascertain the mentioned limitation of KAZE we make use of Accelerated-KAZE, which uses pyramidal structure with Fast Explicit Diffusion incorporated in it, thus minimizing the computation in the step of feature detection of nonlinear scale space. Also, with the use of M-LDB (Modified-Local Difference Binary) descriptor the problem of rotation is solved. Usage of RANSAC after processing in two methods had some disadvantages. It gave bad results when the inliers ratio in the dataset is low. Thus, Optimal RANSAC is employed which works well even when the inliers ratio is as low as 5%. The proposed methods are tested on many standard datasets and various performance parameters. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",AKAZE; AOS schemes; Diffusion; Face recognition; Fast Explicit; KAZE; nonlinear scale space; Optimal RANSAC; RANSAC,Feature extraction; Nonlinear analysis; Taps; AKAZE; AOS scheme; Fast explicit; Features detections; KAZE; Natural boundary; Nonlinear scale space; Optimal RANSAC; RANSAC; Similarity-matching; Face recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vinay, A.; Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence, India; email: a.vinay@pes.edu",Singh M.Tyagi V.Gupta P.K.Flusser J.Oren T.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,9.78303E+12,,,English,Commun.

In order to deliver accurate and high quality surveillance in the context of smart cities, image de-raining is a crucial subject that has been explored extensively in recent years. In order to handle the challenge of removing raindrops, two different strategies are adopted in this research study: The Diffusion model and the Generative adversarial network model. By considering the recent improvements in image deraining methods, this research study proposes a novel technique that makes use of conditional generative adversarial network with adversarial loss, which provides a factor to loss functions and regulates the output for achieving the improved results. In addition, diffusion modelling, a novel patch-based method is used to perform image restoration. Diffusion probabilistic frameworks are used for normalising noise over affected regions. This research study compares and evaluates how well these two techniques perform in eliminating the raindrops from images.

This research study presents a module that can be used to improve the performance of spam filters. This module can be integrated as an extension to these spam filters. The module accepts only encrypted emails to eliminate privacy concerns. Since no copies of the decrypted emails are maintained on the server, the emails are not available to the spam filter module.

Stillbirth can be a result of advanced maternal age, smoking, obesity, comorbid conditions, poor economic status, drug use during pregnancy, etc. Though evidences suggest a number of factors contributing to stillbirth, use of analgesics adds an extra burden for the occurrence of stillbirth. Every drug has its own set of pros and cons, which may directly or indirectly affect the foetal health. Drug exposure was associated with the two-fold increased risk of stillbirth in pregnancy. Due to lack of significant evidence suggesting the occurrence of stillbirth which is a result of analgesic use, control over the use of analgesics during pregnancy is not well established. Hence, in the current literature review, the risk of analgesic-induced stillbirth is highlighted. The misuse of analgesics as over-the-counter medicines is widely known. Painkillers are often used to self-medicate without the supervision of a medical practitioner. Some of these drugs tend to cross the placental barrier and can have hazardous effects on foetus. Many circumstances might drive a pregnant woman to use analgesics which includes pain associated with the adaptation of mother’s body to the change during pregnancy. Due to ease of access and lack of knowledge about foetal risk, analgesics are consumed irrationally leading to pregnancy-related complications such as stillbirth. © 2023, IP Innovative Publication Pvt.

One of the ways to do this efficiently is through cooperative caching. Cooperative caching allows sharing of data between the nodes themselves, reducing the load on the central servers and providing faster retrieval of requested data. The existing methods to place data in machine caches are deterministic and have well-defined limits with respect to the gain that could be achieved. Reinforcement learning methods are stochastic in nature and are not constrained by these limits.

It corresponds to a person’s daily internet activity. Open-source intelligence can be used to collect data in a variety of ways, which is later put to use for social engineering attacks. The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of data that is freely available online and its potential consequences for personal privacy. This paper discusses the use of machine learning algorithms and tools for automating email phishing attacks. The personal data of the victim is gathered from open-source websites in order to analyze their online activity. This information is then analyzed in an attempt to learn more about the victim’s interests and a relevant email template is created based on this information. The machine learning algorithm is then provided with the constructed template, which predicts how successful a phishing attack would be if launched. This paper uses a machine learning algorithm that is composed of support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). This hybrid algorithm, which is a combination of SVM and logistic regression, achieves a peak accuracy of 99.69% when compared to using only one type of classification method, such as SVM or LR. The purpose of this paper is to increase the effectiveness of phishing attacks by automating the data extraction process and to analyse the success rate of attack using machine learning before launching it. This paper will serve the interests of institutions/companies by providing a convenient way to conduct automatic phishing as part of Cyber-Security training to educate employees, giving them a practical experience of social engineering attack. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Gophish; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Open Source Data; Phishing; Python-Django; Selenium; Social engineering attack; Spear phishing; Support Vector Machine; Web Scrapping,Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Electronic mail; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Personnel training; Selenium; Support vector machines; Gophish; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Open source datum; Phishing; Python-django; Social engineering; Social engineering attack; Spear phishing; Support vectors machine; Web scrapping; Python,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hegde, A.M.; Department of CSE Bengaluru, India; email: adityahegde0011@gmail.com",Singh M.Tyagi V.Gupta P.K.Flusser J.Oren T.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,9.78303E+12,,,English,Commun.

We also provide different model variations which suggest different methods of injecting emotion embeddings into the TTS and various tactics of combining them with style embeddings. Tests conducted on our model variation which overlays emotion embeddings on the encoder outputs during inference and combines them with style embeddings in a 3:7 weight-ratio as per our novel approach gives a Mean Opinion Score of 3.612 which shows the more-than-satisfactory performance of our models in synthesizing style varying emotional speech. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Emotional TTS; Modified GST-Tacotron; Style and Emotion Embeddings,Deep learning; Embeddings; Speech analysis; Embeddings; Emotional speech; Emotional TTS; Encoder outputs; Model variation; Modified GST-tacotra; Style and emotion embedding; Target speaker; Text-to-speech system; Weight ratios; Speech synthesis,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhat, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Karnataka, India; email: abhijnya.bhat@gmail.com",Singh M.Tyagi V.Gupta P.K.Flusser J.Oren T.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,9.78303E+12,,,English,Commun.

Hence, potato leaves disease prediction is considered for this study. Several imaging models and intelligent approaches were implemented in the past, but their segmentation is inappropriate due to the different pixel ranges in the affected region. So, the current work has implemented a novel Krill Herd-based optimized Convolution Neural Model (KHbOCNM) for the potato leaves disease specification process. Moreover, the potato leaf disease considered in this research investigation is Early Blight (EB) and Late Blight (LB). Moreover, the graph cut segmentation procedure has been implemented to gain the exact segmentation outcome of the disease-affected part. Incorporating the Krill herd function with the graph cut segmentation in the classification layer has afforded a significant outcome as improved segmentation accuracy of 96% and a 4% error rate. It is a sufficient score for segmenting the disease region accurately and better than the traditional methods. Hence, the proper segmentation yields to attain the exact severity prediction; it is considered as the major significance of the study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Convolution neural network; Early blight; Graph cut segmentation; Krill herd optimization; Light blight; Severity analysis,Forecasting; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Convolution neural network; Disease severity; Early blight; Graph-cut segmentations; Imaging modeling; Krill herd optimization; Leaf disease; Light blight; Optimisations; Severity analysis; Convolution,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rapaka, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Andhra Pradesh, India; email: anuj.rapaka24@gmail.com",,Springer,13807501,,MTAPF,,English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172008244,,,,,,,

The goal of this paper is to develop a privacy-preserving system for diagnosing diseases using machine learning models and a swarm learning network, which utilizes pictures of patient finger nails as input. The Swarm learning framework allows multiple edge devices to collaborate without the need for a central server by sharing only model parameters, while also eliminating the need for trust between the edge devices. The proposed approach in this paper uses transfer learning models (VGG16, InceptionV3) within a swarm learning framework that accurately predict 7 different diseases (80% accuracy). The models can easily be replaced with others and can process inputs, share parameters, and update models on edge devices without the need for a central server. Despite limited training data, the decentralised approach yields comparable or better accuracy compared to centralised models.

Winning as many games as possible is in the minds of all the teams. Making the right choices at each crossroad of the game enhances the chance of victory for each side. We adopt a ball-by-ball input to simulate a ball-by-ball output capturing the true dynamics of limited-over cricket. Most of the existing work in this domain focuses on game outcome prediction based on a static view of the various variables influencing the outcome of such a game. The existing game simulation research takes ball-by-ball input but mainly simulates game outcomes, thereby falling short of simulating the dynamics of limited-over cricket that made it so successful. The simulator described in this paper predicts the likely outcome among the 57 identified possibilities for each ball, considering the current state defined by 20 carefully analyzed features. We examined the simulations with several evaluation metrics comparing them with actual matches and found the simulator quite promising. The model can produce a detailed, realistic ball-to-ball simulation of an entire match starting from the beginning or any arbitrary point in the game with the performances of every player part of it. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Ball by ball simulation; Cricket; Deep learning; IPL; T20,Deep learning; 'current; Ball by ball simulation; Cricket; Deep learning; Game simulation; IPL; Outcome prediction; Prediction-based; Simulation research; T20; Dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mysore, A.S.; PES UniversityIndia; email: aravindmsubramanya@gmail.com",Bansal J.C.Sharma H.Chakravorty A.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,21903018,9.78982E+12,,,English,Smart Innov.

Systems like these are unreliable and can be responsible for data corruption as well as the loss of crucial information. Along with the previous concern, doctors cannot access this crucial information in times of emergency if the patient has been admitted to another hospital because the patient information has been stored locally on a different server. Decentralized storage is an approach that has not been successfully implemented in the market yet. This work involves implementing an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) network to store and retrieve healthcare documents when required. By using an interactive and convenient user interface, a quick and responsive application to securely store these documents has been created. Since the convenience of patients is of the utmost priority as it is a factor of time and effort, the patients are connected to the internet via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, which allows for quick authentication as well as fully automates the protocol of manual registration every time a patient visits a medical establishment. The nodes would further require an RFID scanner on which the user can scan his or her card that contains a Unique Identification Number, for authentication. IPFS uses strong cryptographic hashing to encrypt the documents. The entire process of storing medical records and documents has been automated, and using such technologies makes it feasible and secure at a high level, which also complies with the healthcare storage standards. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Blockchain; Cryptographic hashing; Interplanetary file system; Kademlia; Merkle DAG; Peer-to-Peer; RFID; SHA-256,Authentication; Cloud storage; Cryptography; File organization; Health care; Medical information systems; Microporosity; Radio frequency identification (RFID); User interfaces; Block-chain; Cryptographic hashing; Filesystem; Interplanetary file system; Kademlia; Merkle DAG; Peer to peer; Radio-frequency-identification; SHA-256; System frequency; Blockchain,,,,,,,,,,,,"John, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: pauljohn2802@gmail.com",Jeena Jacob I.Kolandapalayam Shanmugam S.Izonin I.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

Under supervision, a group of people would undergo training for a minimum of three months before they were allowed to become call operators. But this procedure is quite tedious and time-consuming. A person typically calls such an operator to get some kind of immediate assistance when they find themselves in an emergency. However, based on the caller’s emergency information, the operator must decide which department’s services must be sent out. Additionally, all incoming calls are handled in a queue-like manner. Therefore, if the operator spends a significant amount of time talking to a caller, it is possible that the callers in the queue that follow them will receive assistance very late. The aim of this project is to develop an application that could simulate an automated call operator.

According to World Health Organization (WHO), there are approximately 2.2 billion people who are completely blind. They need to depend on primitive solutions like white canes, trained dogs, or other people. But these helping hands cannot always assist them. The affected people need a smart assisting device that avoids bumping into an obstacle and helps in navigating from one place to another independently. This proposed work describes the smart walking stick which makes blind people walk safely. By using the latest technologies and IoT devices, this smart walking stick can be developed where it provides safe navigation to the user. The proposed system employs a novel solution for navigation in indoor with the help of deep learning algorithms. In case of panic situations or emergency conditions, the predefined message with the user's location will be sent to the caretaker using an API.

The mechanism of excitation is similar to that of a brushless alternator, but since the motor has a varying speed, the relative speed of the exciter rotor flux with respect to its stator is kept constant. This is facilitated by having a slip frequency supply to the exciter stator. In order to validate field production, the main motor is supplied with a slow-ramping three-phase voltage, which causes the main rotor to lock with the field and run as a synchronous motor. The design of such a motor with a precise control mechanism reduces cost, enhances the overall speed-range, and ensures safe field shutdown in the event of loss of normal control, preventing overvoltage due to a fast spinning motor. Most of the currently used commercial motors employ permanent magnet rotors, but the availability of raw materials used for production of this particular subsystem is grossly inadequate in our country, resulting in large-scale imports of the same. As an effort towards import substitution, apart from the objective of enhancing operational efficiency, this study has made a beginning towards substituting permanent magnets with an electromagnet. In this context, this paper details the outcome of using slip frequency excitation coupled with scalar control on the performance of the motor. © 2023 IEEE.",scalar control; SPWM; Variable frequency excitation; wound field synchronous motor,Permanent magnets; Stators; Brushless alternators; Field variables; Frequency excitation; Scalar control; Slip frequency; SPWM; Variable frequencies; Variable frequency excitation; Variable speed; Wound field synchronoi motor; Synchronous motors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

It is a daunting task to monitor the banks for human-based security, considering long hours. Autonomous surveillance robots, in such situations, are beneficial to patrol a particular environment by collecting data with an electronic payload. DRISHTI, the proposed robot model designed using Robot Operating System (ROS), includes facial recognition to raise an alert if any suspect is detected, and human tracking is implemented during night patrolling. An Intrusion Alarm Panel (IAP) is employed using external sensors to detect any unethical breaking of the vault in addition to the anti-theft feature. The robot surveillance is aided by autonomous patrolling using Cartographer-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The accuracy of the generated map of the prototype is found to be 95.31% with respect to the corresponding ground truth. The design of a novel priority mux is proposed to integrate the surveillance functionalities with the navigation node.

A tumor can be cancerous or non-cancerous. Non-cancerous skin lesions are called benign. Common skin tumors that are malignant include squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Melanoma is one of the harmful forms of malignant skin tumor, which accounts for the majority of deaths caused by skin cancer.

To overcome the above challenge, effective schemes for detecting and correcting MLC memory errors up to magnitude-3 are presented and evaluated in this work. The proposed Single Level-Single Error Correction (SL-SEC) scheme is capable of detecting and correcting a single bit error occurring at any bit position of a cell in MLC memories and the Multi-level-Single Error Correction (ML-SEC) scheme corrects a single bit Limited Magnitude Error (LME) occurring at multiple levels simultaneously. For a 32-bit data with 3-bits per cell configured MLC memory, the proposed ML-SEC scheme consumes 58% less area and 64.41% less power for the encoder, and 32.81% less area and 41.83% less power for the decoder. The Interleaved Parity-Single Error Correction-Double Adjacent Error Correction (IP-SEC-DAEC) schemes protect all the bits present in a cell. For a 32-bit data with 3-bits per cell MLC memory, the proposed H-matrix of low redundancy IP-SEC-DAEC scheme consumes 12.12% less area and 13.34% less power for the encoder, and 11% less area and 11.34% less power for the decoder than the existing H-matrix. The proposed schemes are compared with the existing alternatives and the findings show that the proposed techniques are significantly more effective in terms of encoding, error detection and correction circuitry complexity, as well as in terms of delay, area, and power overhead. © 2023 IEEE.",Error correction codes; Flash memories; Interleaved Parity (IP) codes; Limited-Magnitude Errors; Multi-level Cell memories; Single Error Correction-Double Adjacent Error Correction (SEC-DAEC) codes,Bit error rate; Decoding; Error correction; Error detection; Flash memory; Matrix algebra; Signal encoding; Cell memory; Error correction codes; Interleaved parity code; Limited-magnitude error; Magnitude error; Multi-level cell memory; Multilevels; Parity codes; Single error correction-double adjacent error correction code; Single error corrections; Cells,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ashwin Kumar, T.; Pes University, India; email: ashwinkumart1999@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc.

This model will be built using data on a variety of house features, such as location, size, age, and condition, as well as the sale prices of the houses. In order to commence, we have gathered and prepared the required data so that it is available for analysis. Managing missing or inaccurate numbers and making sure the data is consistent and appropriately reflects the properties and their sale prices may be involved in this. Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the relationships between the various house features and the sale prices. This involves visualizing the data and identifying patterns and trends that may be useful for building the prediction model. After having a good understanding of the data, next comes building and training the prediction model. This involves selecting and optimizing an appropriate machine learning algorithm, such as linear regression or a decision tree, as well as selecting and engineering relevant features for the model. The model will then be put through its paces using suitable metrics such as R squared and any necessary corrections will be made to increase its accuracy. Users can inquiry price by giving a series of features which describes their ideal house and can get the recommended price.

However, this shift towards cloud computing also brings with it a host of new security challenges. Data stored on public cloud infrastructure is susceptible to various types of vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks that can compromise its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. To address these concerns, we propose an innovative architecture that integrates multiple entities - including multiple public clouds, a private cloud, smart contracts, and the data owner, client, or user. Our decentralized cloud architecture provides a robust form of security for data by incorporating smart contracts between the data owner and the private cloud, as well as between the client and the data owner. By utilizing this approach, we can help ensure that data is protected from unauthorized access, while also providing users with a highly flexible and scalable solution for managing their data in the cloud. With our architecture, businesses and individuals can enjoy the benefits of cloud-based storage while also maintaining the highest levels of security and peace of mind. © 2023 IEEE.",client; cloud; data owner; smart contract.

We propose a system that can augment the capabilities of surveillance systems by automatically tagging sequences of violence in real-time. Instead of relying on a bigger network like CNN-LSTM, our system uses DTW to measure the similarity between two sequences of body joint angles over time and uses this feature as an input to different classifiers, thus reducing the need for a big video dataset to perform action recognition. For person detection on the individual frames we employ YoloV3 and then DeepSort is used to track different individuals over time then use this as an input to OpenPose to obtain the key points, the obtained key points are used to calculate different joint angles. The joint angles can be seen as temporal signals which can be compared with different joint angle signals over time and find the similarity measure and use this as a feature to classifiers like SVM, KNN, and Random forests. The results are at par with the ones that use CNN-based classifiers trained on larger data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Action recognition; DTW; Pose Estimation,Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Gesture recognition; Real time systems; Security systems; Support vector machines; Action recognition; DTW; Human labor; Joint angle; Keypoints; Metropolitan cities; Pose-estimation; Real- time; Surveillance systems; Violence detections; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,,,,,,"Omkar, S.N.; ARTPARK, India; email: omkar@iisc.ac.in",Gupta D.Bhurchandi K.Murala S.Raman B.Kumar S.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,9.78303E+12,,,English,Commun.

Attackers make use of vulnerabilities in the application design to perform data theft. Therefore, there is a need to implement an intrusion detection mechanism that is specific to the application architecture. The Microservices Architecture is predominantly used by organizations to develop their software applications. This application design architecture is a group of individual services that interact through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). As the number of API endpoints increases, there is an increase in the attack surface for hackers to exploit the application. The activity at these endpoints and API calls can be monitored to check for anomalies, which indicates abnormal behaviour. An API call refers to a request made to an API endpoint. Multiple API calls among the services generate API traffic in the application. This traffic can be analyzed for detecting unusual behaviour. In this paper, a machine-learning based technique, API Traffic Anomaly Detection (API-TAD), that detects anomalies in API traffic at two levels - a generalized level, and an application-specific level is proposed. This makes it a more efficient and accurate anomaly detection, not only in the network layer of the OSI model, but also in the application layer. © 2023 IEEE.",Anomaly detection; API traffic; bagging; Data breach; Denial of Service (DoS) detection; Machine Learning models; Microservice architecture; Microservices; RandomForest,Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Denial-of-service attack; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network architecture; Network layers; Network security; Personal computing; Anomaly detection; Application programming interface traffic; Applications programming interfaces; Bagging; Data breach; Denial of Service; Denial of service detection; Machine learning models; Microservice; Microservice architecture; Randomforest; Anomaly detection,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sowmya, M.; PES University, India; email: sowmya7501@gmail.com",Simmhan Y.Altintas I.Varbanescu A.-L.Balaji P.Prasad A.S.Carnevale L.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

Scalability refers to the scheduler's ability to support both the increasing scale of the workloads (in terms of arrival rate and resource demand) and the infrastructure required by these workloads. Scheduling quality refers to the scheduler's ability to meet the user's performance requirements (such as latency guarantees and placement constraints) without compromising the data center's resource utilization.We propose two solutions to achieve scalability and high-quality scheduling. The first is Megha, a decentralized, federated scheduling framework that uses an eventually-consistent global state to make fast, high-quality scheduling decisions for data centers with tens of thousands of nodes. The second is an intra-node scheduling technique called Niyama, which provides robust CPU bandwidth isolation to latency-sensitive tasks - protecting them from interference from co-located tasks. The two frameworks have been evaluated using workloads generated from publicly available cluster traces, and the results show significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art solutions. © 2023 IEEE.",cgroups; data center scheduling; federated architecture; resource isolation,Arrival rates; Cgroup; Data center scheduling; Datacenter; Federated architecture; High quality; Optimisations; Quality scheduling; Resource demands; Resource isolation; Scalability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thiyyakat, M.; PES UniversityIndia; email: meghanathiyyakat@pesu.pes.edu",Simmhan Y.Altintas I.Varbanescu A.-L.Balaji P.Prasad A.S.Carnevale L.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

Although visual media is widely available, the accessibility for individuals with visual impairments is inadequate. Most successful attempts at improving scene understanding require laborious manual work as automation is minimal. In recent years, there has been significant research in the field of generating descriptions for videos and the processing of images. Our primary goal is to generate accurate descriptions of the scenes in a given video and to present a framework for automating the generation of these descriptions. Through our framework, we were able to obtain better METEOR scores than previous automated implementations with a METEOR score of 0.46 with the MSVD dataset and 0.134 with the MPII Movie Description Dataset. The implementation divides the process into many incremental steps to generate descriptions for all the individual scenes in a given video. The framework involves preprocessing the given video, followed by a process known as keyframe extraction. This generates an output of the most relevant frames in the given video. This is fed as input to the image captioning algorithm that generates a caption for every single keyframe. Following this, we use a summarisation method to obtain a description of every scene in a given video. Our framework provides the ability to separate the task into many steps or modules, each of which can be separately improved. This allows the framework the scope to constantly evolve as more research and breakthroughs are achieved in the relevant fields. © 2023 IEEE.",CLIP; Image Captioning; Image Optimization; Keyframe Extraction; Scene Description; Scene Understanding; Video Description,Computer vision; Audio videos; CLIP; Image captioning; Image optimization; Key-frame extraction; Multimedia contents; Scene description; Scene understanding; Video contents; Video description; Extraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saldanha, D.L.; Pes University, India; email: saldanha.dan@gmail.com",Chakrabarti S.Paul R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE World AI IoT Congr., AIIoT",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166667809

Online forums which enable users to express sarcasm as a sentiment tend to induce misunderstandings between different parties and obscure the users' true intentions. This leads to ambiguity being one of the prime challenges in detecting sarcasm. Another challenge in sarcasm detection is the rapidly growing size of language vocabularies with the addition of new slang words every day. Additionally, usage of emojis in online text can greatly influence the polarity of a sentence by inducing a sarcastic tone. These setbacks make sarcasm a particularly demanding sentiment to determine. In this paper, the statistical significance of various deep learning models for the purpose of detecting sarcasm in online comments containing emojis is explored. For the task of binary classification, GRU achieves an accuracy score of 73.44% with an F1-score of 73.96%. The proposed ensemble-based approach yields an accuracy score of 74.41% for the combination of LSTM and GRU, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved with conventional ensemble techniques such as max-voting and averaging. Twenty-six different hybrid combinations of deep learning models were explored and the most optimal performing ones were identified. CNN and Global Average Pooling 1D are two other architectures that were explored. © 2023 IEEE.",CNN; deep learning; deviation; ensemble technique; GRU; LSTM; max-voting; neural networks; sarcasm detection,E-learning; Learning systems; Deep learning; Deviation; Ensemble algorithms; Ensemble techniques; GRU; Learning models; LSTM; Max-voting; Neural-networks; Sarcasm detection; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Int.

The proposed approach makes the time domain expression of the window function dependent on six window parameters. For each set of window parameters, the window function generates distinct window characteristics such as peak sidelobe level and mainlobe width with an asymptotic decay of 42 dB/octave. Each set of window characteristics finds use in different filtering applications. The proposed four-term window function has six unknown parameters, which require six equations to determine them. These equations are obtained from the criteria for the maximum asymptotic decay of the window. Four window functions, each with unique set of peak sidelobe and mainlobe width but with the same decay (42 dB/octave), are synthesized and their frequency response plots are shown.

Due to several invasions and climatic changes over the years, these magnificent works of art did not last very long. A novel Deep Learning approach is proposed in this work to digitally restore broken and eroded pieces of heritage temples and sculptures in India. This approach uses Gated Convolution and Contextual Attention layers added to Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). The learning of this model is enabled by using copyright-free images of Indian temples and sculptures after going through data collection and data pre-processing steps. The data pre-processing involves resizing and applying free-form masks on missing pieces. The final images restored by this model have an L1 loss of 0.29 after training the model for 7,10,000 iterations.

In fields like medical sciences and cybersecurity, it is essential for the model's predictions to be understandable so that informed decisions can be taken accordingly. A Cyber Physical System (CPS) is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms. A CPS is divided into three layers, application control layer, data transmission layer and perception execution layer. Attacks can be performed in any of these layers.

The detection of indoor violent activities is a major challenge in the surveillance sector due to the lack of sufficient indoor footage, and the presence of obstacles inducing occlusions in a household environment. Several studies on the topic of violence detection have been done, with the best performing models using Convolutional Neural Networks for spatial feature learning, followed by a Recurrent Neural Network variant for temporal feature learning. Recent studies suggest that Vision Transformers have a better run-time and are more robust to partial occlusions than their deep convolutional network counterparts. In this paper, we present a light-weight transformer model, drawing upon the recent success of video vision transformers in action recognition. The model extracts spatial features from the input frames, and adds temporal relation to the selected frames with the help of tubelet embedding, which are then encoded using various transformer layers. Generally, although transformer models are shown to need extensive training on large datasets, it has been proven that using efficient preprocessing, we can train the model on comparatively small sized datasets. The light-weight model has achieved an accuracy of 88.24% on our self-curated indoor violence dataset and a 98% accuracy on a subset containing videos in which the subjects involved in the activity are occluded from view. © 2023 IEEE.",indoor violence detection; occlusion; transformer; tubelet embedding,Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Embeddings; Recurrent neural networks; Security systems; Embeddings; Feature learning; Indoor violence detection; Light weight; Occlusion; Spatial features; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Tubelet embedding; Violence detections; Large dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kumar, A.; PES University, India; email: arushi32001@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of various classification models to classify COVID-19 from Chest X-ray images and devise an automated, precise model to segment the COVID-19 infected regions present in Chest CT Scans and make the results interpretable with the use of GradCAM. A total of 4000 images from the COVID-19 Radiography dataset were used for training and evaluating the models. In order to predict COVID-19 in Chest X-rays, the transfuse segmentation model [1] is used to segment the lungs. Radiomic features are then extracted and the most essential features were selected using Principle Component Analysis which were then used to train six classification models, namely support vector machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees, AdaBoost (AB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. Support vector machines was the best-performing classifier with an accuracy of 0.9115 and an AUC of 0.9117. In the case of CT scans, lungs were segmented using image processing techniques, and a total of 2482 CT Scans from the SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan Dataset were used to train a ResNet18 CNN architecture, whose results were made interpretable by employing gradCAM. Furthermore, infections were segmented from the CT scans using two image processing based approaches, the first making use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform and the second approach performing morphological operations. The ResNet18 CNN used for assisting GradCAM achieved a testing accuracy of 96.34%. In order to evaluate the results, the infections were compared with 25 manually segmented CT scans and achieved a precision of 0.975, a recall of 0.960, and an IOU score of 0.937. © 2023 IEEE.",Chest X-Rays; Contrast and Erosion; COVID-19; CT Scans; Discrete Wavelet Transform; GradCAM; Lung Segmentation; PCA; SVM; Transfuse,Adaptive boosting; Computerized tomography; Decision trees; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image segmentation; Mathematical morphology; Nearest neighbor search; Principal component analysis; Signal reconstruction; Support vector machines; X ray radiography; Chest X-ray; Classification models; Contrast and erosion; CT-scan; Discrete-wavelet-transform; GradCAM; Lung segmentation; PCA; Support vectors machine; Transfuse; COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Krishnan, A.; PES University, India; email: ashwathkrishnan45@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Most of the prominent techniques for testing are based on dynamic analysis. Although dynamic analysis handles run-time integration, it does not address the quality of the code and hence the maintainability of the software. Static analysis, which is the analysis of code without execution, can be used to mitigate these issues. Using this technique, the adherence of code to a coding standard can be ascertained. The use of a specific standard improves readability and code maintainability. Traditional methods used for this purpose have been language-specific, and support for user-specified guidelines has been poor.This paper presents a tool that checks the conformance of the source code with user-curated guidelines. A simple, intuitive, and concise manner to specify guidelines is introduced. These guidelines are language-agnostic, thus allowing a uniform style to express them for multiple languages. A library of predefined guidelines has been provided to facilitate rapid development, and methods to add new guidelines are also expounded. Additionally, these guidelines can be used to verify if certain programming constructs have been used. Thus, it brings the codebase closer to the requirement specification document, allowing the programmer to effortlessly implement the code without worrying about its conformance. Lastly, an universal coding metric and benchmarking tool named LAPCA Score is provided which quantifies the extent of guideline violations that can be used to measure the degree of code compliance. © 2023 IEEE.",code quality; coding guidelines; conformance; language agnostic; static analysis,Maintainability; Quality control; Software design; Verification; Code quality; Coding guideline; Conformance; Dynamics analysis; Language agnostic; ON dynamics; Runtimes; Software-systems; Time-integration; Verification of softwares; Static analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reddy, M.; PES University, India; email: manishreddym22@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

The primary goal is to resolve the problems these kids are having and to help them realize that this illness does not define or restrict who you can be or place you in a superior or inferior position to others. We propose a system to detect ASD in children using two approaches viz., behavioral traits and facial images. In the behavioral trait approach, eight individual traits that have been found to be useful in diagnosing ASD patients based on controls in behavioral science are added to the ten behavioral features (AQ-10-Child) that have been approved by the National Institute of Health Research (NHS) in the behavioral trait approach. In the facial recognition approach, the images of the children are used and pass them into the pretrained CNN EfficientNet model which detects the presence of autism. Finally, we integrate these machine learning models into a fully functional website which will act as a link between the users and the admin team. © 2023 IEEE.",(ASD-Autism Spectrum Disorder; CNN-Convolutional Neural Network; EfficientNet; Facial recognition; Keypoint detection; KNN-K Nearest Neighbour; ML-Machine Learning; SVM-Support Vector Machine; Vision Transformer; WHO-World Health Organization),Behavioral research; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Diagnosis; Diseases; Face recognition; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; (ASD-autism spectrum disorder; Autism spectrum disorders; CNN-convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network; Efficientnet; Facial recognition; Keypoint detection; KNN-K near neighbor; Machine-learning; ML-machine learning; Nearest-neighbour; Support vectors machine; SVM-support vector machine; Vision transformer; WHO-world health organization); World Health Organization; Support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhavana Yadav, K.; PES University, India; email: bhavanayadav7090@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

The circuit architecture of the existing serial parallel multiplier has been modified to reduce the resource constraints and also to improvise on area, power and delay. The proposed SPM architecture reduces the complexity of existing architecture i.e by reducing number of blocks of implementation. The existing SPM and proposed SPM both are realised using verilog code and tested in Quartus 18.1 environment. It shows improvement in consumption of resources, area and power. Further the proposed architecture can be extended for optimisation of latency and delay constraints. The test was carried out for both 4 bit and 8 bit SPM architecture design. In comparison with existing architectures the proposed method shows 18.5% reduction in consumption of resources. The proposed architecture can find utmost applications in various domains where digital multiplication is critical. © 2023 IEEE.",area efficiency; less resource constraints; power efficiency; Serial parallel multiplier (SPM),Efficiency; Area efficiency; Existing architectures; Less resource constraint; Parallel multiplier architecture; Parallel multipliers; Power; Power-efficiency; Resource Constraint; Serial parallel multiplier; Serial parallels; Delay circuits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nithyashree, R.V.; PES University, Karnataka, India; email: nithyashreerv@pesu.pes.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

This paper focuses on classifying an input text in English, Hindi and Hinglish (Hindi written in English) along with emojis and emoticons into three categories - Abusive, Hate Speech or Neither based on the confidence scores of each class. Abusive language on social media is textual content that contains disparaging words. Hate speech can be threatening and can hurt the sentiments of a person or a community. To gain better insights, results are captured with and without lemmatization and stemming. Accuracy is used as the metric to evaluate the classification models. Deep learning models BERT and RoBERTa are trained separately on plain English data (PE), Hinglish data along with emojis (HEmo) and the combined full dataset (CF). The same process is repeated for five non-deep learning models - Decision trees, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and Naïve Bayes. The deep learning model RoBERTa results in the highest accuracy of 0.9938 on the PE dataset, 0.9896 on the EHEmo dataset and 0.9899 on the CF dataset.

However, the limited energy resources of these nodes can be a major limitation to their performance and lifetime. Optimal sensor placement not only minimizes the consumption of limited energy of battery-driven sensors but also reduces the sensing of redundant information. Hence it is of utmost importance to optimize the energy consumed by a wireless sensor network for better sustainability. In this project, we focus on bio-inspired optimization algorithms concerning the optimal sensor node placement in WSNs for a smart agriculture setup namely the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and LEACH Algorithm and prove that the latter is the better algorithm suited for energy conservation by soil moisture wireless sensor nodes placed in a WSN and the same can be extended to any real-life application.

An effective patrolling strategy helps in making communities feel more secure and safe. With limited resources, optimizing patrol routes is crucial to cover crime hotspots effectively and reduce response times during emergencies. This study proposes a novel approach to utilize spatial crime data for police patrol route planning. The road network is modeled as an edge-weighted graph, and a custom weight function is used to assign weights to the graph, determining the hotspots. Clustering techniques are then applied to filter hotspots, and an ant colony optimization algorithm is used to plan the routes. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any jurisdiction provided that historical spatial crime data is available. By utilizing the proposed method, law enforcement agencies can enhance their patrolling strategies, resulting in targeted and more efficient approaches to maintaining community safety and security. © 2023 IEEE.",Police patrolling problem; Road network graph; Route planning; Spatial data analytics; vehicle routing problem,Ant colony optimization; Crime; Roads and streets; Vehicle routing; Crime data; Data analytics; Networks/graphs; Police patrolling problem; Road network; Road network graph; Route planning; Spatial data; Spatial data analytic; Vehicle Routing Problems; Data Analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abhay, D.A.; PES University, India; email: abhayda2001@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

However, in dense deployments of such Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) as in overlapped Basic Service Sets (OBSSs) and with the options to enhance the channel bandwidths to 80/160 MHz (for IEEE 802.11ac/ax), due to increased contention the performance suffers. This is manifested as reduction in the overall throughput much lower than that can be ideally achieved by the network. Thus, if the throughput of a network prior to the deployment is roughly known, the real-life deployment could be optimally chosen by reworking the deployment parameters. Machine Learning (ML) is a promising approach to capture the complex interactions among the AP/STA entities, learn the complex inter-relationships and be able to predict the performance parameter i.e. throughput of a given deployment with minimal or partial inputs. To do so, a large dataset of various scenarios of deployment is necessary, which is obtained through simulation using the network simulator Komondor. The ML model using the Graph Neural Network (GNN) captures the deployment details and is able to converge to the throughput values being predicted closely. By tuning the hyperparameters and varying the configuration parameters the ML model is refined to produce significant improvement in the accuracy of prediction of throughput. The results can be used to build and analyze the performance landscape of densedeployed WLANs for arbitrary or systematic deployments for discovery of optimal deployment. © 2023 IEEE.",Komondor; ML; OBSS; RMSE,Complex networks; Graph neural networks; IEEE Standards; Large dataset; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Basic service sets; Channel bandwidth; Internet access; Komondor; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Overlapped basic service set; Performance; RMSE; Throughput analysis; Machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Divya, C.V.; Pes UniversityIndia; email: divyacv@pesu.pes.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

To fully eradicate Covid - 19, which emerged 3 years ago, the entire population needs to be vaccinated, but that's not the case as people hesitate to get vaccinated due to various articles published in newspapers, social media, etc., the authenticity of which are unknown. In this paper we will try to summarize all the articles, as available in the CORD-19 dataset, using BERT and GPT-2 models. For extractive summarization, BERT models performed well, but there is a scope for improvement in abstractive summarization. Our approach involves utilizing regularization to suppress local similarity while simultaneously promoting global similarity, using the distill-gpt2 version with higher computing resources.

The single junction solar cell's performance is mainly limited by thermalization loss and transmission loss. Due to this, tandem solar cells (TSC) have had a significant impact on photonic studies to effectively use the entire sun spectrum and to reduce these losses. The quick growth of perovskite on silicon Tandem devices has been supported by improvements in perovskite material stability and advanced silicon fabrication processes. In this paper, we use SCAPS software to check out a TSC with the c-Si (bandgap: 1.12 eV) as the bottommost subcell and the lead-free organic-inorganic hybrid PSC i.e., MASnBr3 (bandgap: 1.3 eV) where MA= Methyl Ammonium (CH3NH3) as the topmost subcell. The standalone top cell gives an Efficiency (eta) of 32.98 (FF=88.19, Jsc= 33.89, Voc=1.10). The standalone bottom cell gives an Efficiency (eta) of 21.71 (FF=85.23, Jsc=18.84, Voc=0.73). A TSC with MASnBr3 on c-Si shows an Efficiency of 44.35 (FF=82.94, Jsc=15.25, Voc=1.91).

Gait recognition is the study of recognizing people by using their locomotion and other bodily actions. It is another form of behavioral biometric system in which unique attributes of an individual's gait are used to determine their identity. Gait Identification technology concentrates on features like locomotive movement of the whole body, pattern of movement of specific body parts and other such physical features in order to determine the identity of an individual even if their facial features are obscured.In today's world new authentication systems are being developed. So, in this paper we would like to highlight the usage of gait as a medium for authentication. This feature becomes useful when the other biometric features are not available. Also gait identification is contactless unlike fingerprinting. So, we propose a model to uniquely identify people based on their walking style.

While previous research has been successful in detecting salient objects, detecting multiple objects presents unique challenges due to high dissimilarity between objects. The authors have introduced two frameworks, namely non-parametric cluster-based saliency and parametric cluster-based saliency, in order to tackle a problem. The problem pertains to the precise localization and segmentation of salient objects that have clear boundaries and uniform interiors. To address this issue, the authors have developed a deep neural network that directs attention and boundaries towards salient objects. The network employs a channel-wise attention module that assigns greater weight to the significant feature channels. The proposed work has been experimented on various standard datasets and has outperformed existing methods. The paper presents an innovative approach for detecting multiple salient regions, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods. By using foreground clues and a multi-level foreground segmentation strategy, the proposed approach can accurately identify multiple salient regions, regardless of their dissimilarity, size, or shape. In order to address the drawbacks of current approaches, a thorough and innovative method for salient object recognition is presented in this study. By using a combination of frameworks and a deep neural network, the suggested approach can precisely identify multiple salient regions. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",Multiple-salient-region detection; Object segmentation; Saliency map,Object detection; Object recognition; Cluster-based; Foreground segmentation; Multilevels; Multiple-salient-region detection; Objects segmentation; Saliency map; Salient object detection; Salient objects; Salient region detections; Salient regions; Deep neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paramanandam, K.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: kokila.p.anand@gmail.com",,Springer,9756809,,,,English,Intl.

They present themselves as vulnerable targets for malicious users in the network. Malicious nodes are entities in vehicular networks that are intentionally or unintentionally 'misbehaving', and they can cause various problems, such as disrupting communication, stealing sensitive data, or even disabling critical safety systems. This work builds upon the TruMan model to detect and isolate nodes in vehicular networks. An aggregator function is proposed in this work to summarize the behavior of nodes in a network segment, and to identify anomalies that shall indicate the presence of a malicious node. With the integration of the aggregator function to the original TruMan model, the proposed model shows an improvement in the overall rate of network discoverability. © 2023 IEEE.",Aggregator; Malicious Nodes; Trust Models; Vehicular Networks,Motor transportation; Aggregator; Cutting edges; Efficiency increase; Malicious nodes; Network segment; Road safety; Sensitive datas; Traffic efficiency; Trust models; Vehicular networks; Sensitive data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thanikaiselvan V T.S R.D.T S.S K.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"ViTECoN - IEEE Int.

The need to extend the previous models of prosthetic arm is crucial. So, by overcoming a few of the previous limitations we are aiming to build a prosthetic arm which is 3D printable. It's a low-cost Myoelectric arm that can be customized. The main challenge in this is to design a low-cost prosthetic arm which is cost effective with advanced technology that does all basic activities that a real arm does. But such an arm is highly expensive and unavailable to the general public, particularly in developing and under-developed countries. Even though amputees lost their limb, muscles around the affected area continue to function, so we can leverage those muscle simulations using this Myoelectric Prosthesis. This mechanism uses muscle impulses from lost limbs to restore the function of those limbs which are no more in use. Electromyography signals are produced by the arm around the affected area. An EMG sensor is used to measure the small electrical signals generated by the muscles when we move them. Along with that servo motors are used to actuate the arm fingers, every finger has its separate servo motor.

However, balancing the load among the different service providers in the federation is a challenging task. This is because of the enlarged load of each service provider and the demand for Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Live VM migration is an effective mechanism to balance the load among the different Cloud Service Providers (CSP). Yet, none of the works has focused on both inter- and intra- CSP-based live VM migration in the federated cloud. Besides, they utilized traditional techniques (Pre and Post-copy) to perform live VM migration. This increases migration and downtime in a federated cloud environment. Motivated by this, we propose matching-based data center allocation and Duple live VM migration in clustered federated cloud environment (DALMIG). The proposed DALMIG approach tackles the downsides faced in the federated cloud as yet. In this regard, three processes are contributed that are Matching-based Data Center Allocation, Two-Fold Clustering, and Duple live VM migration. Initially, brokers allocate apt data center to each incoming task using Auction-based Bipartite One to N (A-BON) matching algorithm. And then, we execute two-fold clustering process: Here, the data center is clustered using the Kernel Neutrosophic C-Means (kernel NCM) algorithm. And, we cluster VMs in each data center using the Credal C-Means (CCM) algorithm. To maintain the load of each CSP, we maintain two entities, such as a load monitor and a migrator. Here, the load monitor estimates a load of each data center and the migrator performs a live VM migration process. Here, the live VM migration process is performed using the Hybrid Copy technique. We execute both intra- and inter-CSP live VM migration. Here, intra-live VM migration is performed using the State Action Reward State Action (SARSA) algorithm. Inter-CSP live VM migration is accomplished using the Black Widow Optimization (BWO) algorithm. We show our DALMIG performance in the federation using the Cloudsim tool. The simulation results acquired from Cloudsim are auspicious in the context of metrics including latency, response time, number of VM migrations, Migration time, load fairness, and communication overhead. © 2023 IETE.",BWO; Data center allocation; Federated cloud; Hybrid copy; Live VM migration; SARSA,Black widow optimization; Cloud service providers; Data center allocation; Datacenter; Federated clouds; Hybrid copy; Live VM migration; Matchings; Optimisations; State action reward state action; Clustering algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,3772063,,,,English,IETE J Res,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165468639

Nuclei segmentation is a type of computation pathology that enables the identification and separation of Nuclei cells in a histopathology image. These segmentation routines play a critical role in quantification of cellular structures and provide insights to identify abnormalities related to pathological conditions such as cancer. In order to determine the progress and severity of a pathological condition it is necessary to use tools that measure the properties of tissue structure in different stages of a disease. Biomedical image analysis for Nuclei segmentation using deep learning methodologies is an ongoing area of research wherein to improve histopathology examination it is desired to develop a model that can generalize and accurately segment different types of nuclei. However, creating a suitable model for this process is difficult due to variability in patient data, overlapping nuclei cell boundaries, image quality, background noise, and provision of well-annotated data. In this study, we describe our findings on the performance of a model developed using the standard U-Net architecture and compare it against a model that is developed based on pre-trained weights and models using ImageNet as the backbone. The aim is to develop a semantic segmentation model that can capture high-level information in terms of features from a data set that consists of Whole-slide images (WSI). The outcome of the research is to be able to select a semantic segmentation model that is efficient and fast to classify Nuclei cells for the given biomedical tissue images. The model uses a stochastic gradient descent optimizer and the evaluation criteria for this network i.e., the ground truth against prediction is based on Mean Intersection over Union. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",deep learning; histopathology; Jaccard Index; Nuclei segmentation; semantic segmentation; U-Net,Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Gradient methods; Hospital data processing; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Tissue; Cellular structure; Deep learning; Histological images; Histopathology; Jaccard index; Nucleus segmentation; Pathological conditions; Segmentation models; Semantic segmentation; U-net; Pathology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paduri, A.R.; Great LearningIndia; email: anwesh@greatlearning.in",Morusupalli R.Dandibhotla T.S.Atluri V.V.Komati V.R.Windridge D.Lingras P.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,3029743,9.78303E+12,,,English,Lect.

To determine which phrases in a given text are most crucial, the basic model uses TextRank, a graph-based algorithm. In order to group together comparable sentences, these sentences are subsequently clustered using K-means. The best representative statement from each cluster is chosen as the final summary in the last phase of our method using neural network classification. In order to enhance TextRank's functionality, we also suggest an optimization strategy called cosine similarity with TextRank (Cosim-TextRank). In order to further improve the model's accuracy, we also suggest using weighted cosine similarity. Overall, our method successfully creates a summary of the text by choosing significant and illustrative phrases while maintaining the context and content of the original text. The experimental findings demonstrate that, in terms of ROUGE scores and human evaluation, our suggested strategy performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE.",CNN/DailyMail; cosine similarity; extractive text summarization; k-means; sbert; sentence-transformer; text rank; weighted cosine,K-means clustering; Neural networks; Text processing; CNN/dailymail; Cosine similarity; Extractive text summarization; K-means; Neural network classification; Sbert; Sentence-transformer; Text rank; Text Summarisation; Weighted cosine; Graphic methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tangade, A.; Pes UniversityIndia; email: ashwinitangade@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Int.

On the other side, constant use of natural aggregates causes havoc on the ecosystem, necessitating the protection of the natural resources. The current work concentrated on the experimental investigation and prediction of the effects of steel slags as alternatives to natural coarse aggregate on the characteristics of freshly-mixed concrete and freshly-hardened concrete. Concrete’s properties were discovered using the slump flow, compressive strength (CS), and split tensile strength (STS). From the laboratory test of determination, it was seen that the slump flow of concrete decreases as the proportion of substitution of coarse aggregate (CA) with steel slag (SS) increases, while the density of concrete increases. At 28 days after curing, the strength of hardened self-compacting concrete was also evaluated. The material is composed of steel slag combined with natural aggregate to the extent that the maximum STS and maximum CS are used to confirm this. The prediction of a concrete property with steel slag and natural aggregate is investigated by using the Taguchi method. Design of experiment was performed via L9 orthogonal array, and the predicted model shows value close to the experimental results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Regression; Steel slag; Taguchi method,Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Design of experiments; Hardening; Hardness; Self compacting concrete; Slags; Steelmaking; Taguchi methods; Tensile strength; 'current; Coarse aggregates; Natural aggregate; Properties of concretes; Regression; Slump flow; Split tensile strengths; Steel slag; Taguchi's methods; Waste products; Forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dalawai, V.N.; CMR Institute of Technology, Karnataka, India; email: vibha.d@cmrit.ac.in",Shukla S.K.Raman S.N.Bhattacharjee B.Singh P.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23662557,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

As per the reports from different sources, video traffic had acquired 82% of internet usage in 2022. Video is going to be more important in the years to come for user engagement, advertisement & marketing, news, education etc. Video information retrieval becomes an important problem to solve in this context. An accurate and fast video tagging system can aid a good content recommendation to the end users. It helps to audit the content automatically thereby platforms can control the contents which are politically and morally harmful. There are not many faster or cost-effective mechanisms to tag user generated videos at this moment. Manual tagging is a costly and highly time taking task. A delay in indexing the videos like news, sports etc., shall reduce its freshness and relevancy. Deep learning techniques have reached its maturity in the contents like text and images, but it is not the case with videos. Deep learning models need more resources to deal with videos due to its multi-modality nature, and temporal behavior. Apart from that, there are not many large-scale video datasets available at this moment. Youtube-8M is the largest dataset which is publicly available as of now. Much research works happened over Youtube-8M dataset. From our study, all these have a potential limitation. For example, in Youtube-8M, Video labels are only around 3.8K which are not covering all real-world tags. It is not covering the new domains which are created along with the surge in the content traffic. This study aims to handle this problem of tag creation through different methods available thereby enhancing the labels to a much wider set. This work also aims to produce a scalable tagging pipeline which uses multiple retrieval mechanisms, combine their results. The work aims to standardize the retrieved tokens across languages. This work creates a dataset as an outcome from 'WikiData', which can be used for any NLP based standardization use cases. An attempt has been made to do disambiguation through WikiId embedding. A new WikiData embedding is created in this work, which can be used for eliminating the tags which are noisy. © 2023 IEEE.",Keyword Extraction; Token Standardisation; Video Tagging; Video Transcription,Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Embeddings; Large dataset; Embeddings; Internet usage; Keywords extraction; Mapping techniques; Token standardization; Video contents; Video tagging; Video traffic; Video transcription; YouTube; Standardization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thomas, D.; Pes University, India; email: dinu.thomas@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Int.

This project is beneficial when it comes to quick analysis of the medical condition and providing on-time treatment. The challenge in this project is the achievement of clinical accuracy and reduce data bias. On the other hand, this endeavor is essential in meeting medical demands in nations with limited resources due to the shortage of radiologists and radiology training programs. Medical picture captioning or report production is the issue that we'll be solving in this case study. Fundamentally, we must use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a transfer learning algorithm to extract features (bottleneck features) from the photos (preferable as we have less amount of data). Use these traits that were extracted afterward to anticipate the captions. The result would be a string of words resembling a radiologist's report, where a typical report generated by radiologists includes a summary of the findings, a rationale for the examination, and a history of the patient. We were able to create the Python code with this goal in mind. The predictions were analyzed using greedy and beam search techniques. While beam search was shown to create proper phrases, a greedy search was discovered to be significantly faster. In conclusion, a custom final model that uses greedy search is determined to be the best model for this project based on the Bleu score. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",AI; beam search; bottleneck features; ChexNet; CNN; convolutional neural network; greedy search; Image Processing; radiologists; Radiology; transfer learning; X-ray,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Medical imaging; Transfer learning; Beam search; Bottleneck features; Chexnet; Convolutional neural network; Greedy search; Images processing; Medical images processing; Radiologist; Transfer learning; Radiology,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; University Grants Commission, UGC: NO.F.82-27/2019; University Grants Committee, UGC; Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","Acknowledgement. 1.

The farmers are forced to sell their products at a very low price to the middlemen. Meanwhile, consumers are deprived of fresh farm products. Rythu Bazaar, the farmers’ market, was established by the Andhra Pradesh government in the year 1999 to address this issue. Consumers can purchase fresh items directly from farmers, and farmers can sell their goods at the desired price. As a result, the present study examines various parameters where consumers and farmers have benefited from a varity of products such as vegetables, fruits, and so on. In this paper, we try to forecast the product price, which is going to help farmers as well as consumers. We are going to use some statistical approaches to prove that consumers are getting benefited from the Rythu Bazar. In our research, we want to forecast for a long time, i.e., 1 year. We are going to use normal machine learning algorithms along with a few Deep Learning algorithms like RNN (Recurrent neural networks), LSTM (Long short-term memory), and Bidirectional LSTM.

This framework is used as the base to design the chatbot. The topical Chat dataset used here contains approximately 210,000 utterances, which is more than 4,100,000 words. The chatbot analyzed this chat dataset and revealed how individuals interact with one another while discussing various topics. The TED (Transformer Embedding Dialogue) policy is used by Rasa to ensure that conversations are meaningful and are able to stick to the original intent of placing an order. The three inputs and all the features were fed into the transformer. Then, we built a model so that we can train it with the data and then can be used for the prediction and identify improvement opportunities. We simulated ASR hypotheses for each turn in a conversation using four different settings. System A had a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.01–0.39 for the dialogues in the test freq audio and test-uncommon audio, whereas system B had an error rate of about 0.08. We trained our Rasa-based model with topical chat data. Topical chat data includes various conversations on a specific topic in the json files. After training the bot we can ask various questions about around 250 entities and the bot will share fun facts about those entities.

The research on the interpretation of such two-handed sign languages is still in its early stages of growth. To explore the real-time translation of sign languages, the RtTSLC framework is proposed, which translates 26 finger-spelled English alphabet gestures in Indian Sign Language to their corresponding letters. The framework introduces a new technique that creates bounding boxes for two-handed sign languages, and as for classification, state-of-the-art deep learning architectures like VGG16, EfficientNet, and AlexNet have been used. The RtTSLC framework provided promising results, with a recognition accuracy of 92% with the VGG16 architecture, 99% with EfficientNetB0, and 89% with AlexNet in real time.

Despite sizable medical data being available across the world, privacy norms prevent it from being shared. Adding variety to data is impossible without an efficient, privacy-preserving approach to enable data use from multiple sources. This lack of variety in data leads to extremely biased machine learning models. Cancer data, like data of many other diseases, is multivariate and demands personalized treatment protocols, showing importance of the variety that data from multiple sources can bring in. The research work tries to shed light on how decentralized learning can be employed to improve and strengthen clinical research by enabling researchers to analyze diverse insights from heterogeneous data sources. Along with discussing cutting-edge Deep learning architectures for Cancer diagnosis, we show experiments with “Swarm Learning” i.e. HPE’s decentralized machine-learning platform that facilitates collaboration between data owners. This experiment focuses on Breast Cancer tumor diagnosis. As a part of the study, we examined around 1300 histochemical images of breast cancer tumors as well as follow-up records for multiple cases using various deep learning techniques.

Billions of videos are uploaded, played and exchanged between different actors. In this context, automatic video content classification has become a critical and challenging problem, especially in areas like video-based search, recommendation etc. In this work we try to extract frame-level visual and audio features, pre-extracted features are then converted into a compact video level representation effectively and efficiently. We aim to classify the video into a set of categories with high accuracy. From the literature survey, we identified that, the tagging of videos has been a problem which has not reached its maturity yet, and there are many researches happening in this area. It is observed that, the clustering based video description methodologies show a better result compared to the temporal algorithms. We also have identified that, majority of the SOTA techniques use the VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) technique to extract the video features and make the codebook learnable through some adjustments introduced in the NetVLAD. The key descriptors would be mostly noisy, and many of them are insignificant. In this work we aim to cascade a Self-Attention Block on the NetVLAD which can extract the significant descriptors and filter out the Noise. The YouTube 8M dataset shall be used for training the model and performance will be compared with other SOTA techniques. Like other similar works, model performance will be measured by GAP Metric (Global Average Precision) for all the videos predicted labels. We aim to achieve a GAP score close to 85% for this work. © 2023 IEEE.",Self-Attentive NetVLAD; Video Tagging; YouTube-8M,Computer vision; Content classification; Descriptors; Self-attentive NetVLAD; User-generated; Video contents; Video tagging; Video understanding; Visual feature; YouTube; Youtube-8m; Video recording,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Darapaneni, N.; Pes University, India; email: darapaneni@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Int.

This has led to DevOps, which further led to a need for an optimized and integrated approach to implementing CI/CD. This research paper showcases proof of concepts for minimizing human intervention in the operations cycle for software development. It discusses several additions and/or modifications to the traditional implementations of CI/CD pipelines and explores how several DevOps tools can be leveraged to improve them from continuous development and integration to continuous deployment. Our aim is to come up with an improved CI/CD and monitoring process which is convenient for the developers to set up and leverage with the least amount of configuration and manual intervention. Additionally, it proposes a customizable python application to process and maintain the inherently complex logs generated by the pipeline, contributing to the ease of monitoring the pipeline.

To address this gap, we introduce Deep QA(DQA), i.e., a dataset consisting of 12816 questions broadly classified into 4 types of questions. The generated dataset has been analyzed and compared with a standard QA dataset to prove that it demands higher cognitive skills. To prove the point further, state of art models trained on remembering type factive QA dataset have been pre-trained on the proposed dataset and are shown to perform poorly on the question types generated. Finally, some preliminary investigation using a graph neural model has been done to probe the possibility of an alternative answer generation technique on such a dataset of deeper questions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Comprehensive Answers; Deep Questions; Graph based QA; Neural QA; Proposition Bank; Semantic Roles,Graphic methods; Natural language processing systems; 'current; Comprehensive answer; Deep question; Graph based question answering; Graph-based; Neural question answering; Proposition bank; Question Answering; Semantic roles; Semantics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Navalli, H.V.; PES University, Karnataka, India; email: harshavardhannavalli2@gmail.com",Neri F.Du K.-L.Varadarajan V.San-Blas A.-A.Jiang Z.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,9.78303E+12,,,English,Commun.

The use of deep learning algorithms for text generation has various applications across domains. One such application is the ability to synthesize poetry from a collection of poems written by a particular poet. In this paper, a stacked character-level LSTM model has been proposed to generate Shakespeare-style sonnets. The model is trained on the complete set of sonnets written by Shakespeare and is able to generate a new sonnet. To judge the novelty of the generated sonnet, the cosine similarity between a generated sonnet and each sonnet in the corpus has been computed. The qualitative validation of the sonnet has been done by manual methods. The sonnets are judged based on fluency, coherency, meaning and poeticness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",LSTM; Poem generation; Shakespeare,Long short-term memory; Character level; Complete sets; Cosine similarity; Language processing; LSTM; Natural language generation; Natural languages; Poem generation; Shakespeare; Text generations; Natural language processing systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goyal, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Karnataka, India; email: arshgyal@outlook.com",Senjyu T.So-In C.Joshi A.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

The individual com-ponents are a content-based and collaborative filtering-based model, a neural network model, and a graph convolutional network model. The individual models used in today’s scientific landscape focus entirely on a single metric to be tuned and optimized. Through this paper, we introduce a way to balance all metrics, while retaining excellent precision and recall and improving on less focused metrics such as coverage and serendipity. We also explore a novel hybridization technique that represents the recommendation scenario as a graph and infers edges from the dataset to map relevant relationships. Interpretability is the comprehension of a model’s fundamental decision-making. This helps improve users’ trust in the model and is an attempt at understanding the features and their relevance. The results of the hybrid recommender are explained using post hoc interpretability techniques. Additionally, serendipity is used to capture user satisfaction and the factor of “pleasant surprise” with the recommendations. To overcome the subjective nature of evaluating serendipity, we also propose a new distance-based method to calculate it. The results provide a comparison of contrasting and competing metrics of the individual and hybrid models, and also show the balance of metrics achieved by the hybrid models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Graph Convolutional Network; Interpretability; Neural Network; Recommender System; Serendipity,Collaborative filtering; Convolution; Decision making; Graph neural networks; Neural network models; Content-based; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Hybrid model; Individual components; Individual modeling; Interpretability; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Serendipity; Recommender systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Uppal, A.; PES UniversityIndia; email: 2712ananya@gmail.com",Neri F.Du K.-L.Varadarajan V.San-Blas A.-A.Jiang Z.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,9.78303E+12,,,English,Commun.

There are instances where the felon cannot be convicted due to insufficient evidence and sometimes the incident is not even reported. The current law enforcement agencies lack the manpower and technology to combat this. Here lies the incentive to create a system which once automated, can survey a crime-ridden area to capture footage and on the occurrence of a crime, notify the concerned authorities. The proposed model in this paper contains a drone or UAV which is programmed to monitor a locality or town. The camera on the drone captures the frames in which a crime has occurred and sends selected frames to the server (backend) or the CNN. Post training and testing the CNN model, its core competency is to detect whether a crime has occurred in the frames or images received in near real-time. The images from the UAV are also processed within the drone via the facial recognition module using OpenCV. This framework introduces the integration of a Tello Py DJI drone with a facial recognition module and a Dense-Net 121 convolutional neural network. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",API (Application Programming Interface); CNN (Convolutional Neural Network); Facial recognition and detection; UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle); UCF (University of Central Florida),Aircraft detection; Antennas; Application programming interfaces (API); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Face recognition; Aerial vehicle; Application programming interface; Applications programming interfaces; Convolutional neural network; Facial recognition; Facial recognition and detection; University of Central Florida; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Drones,,"We would like to dedicate this section to our guide Dr. Sandesh BJ, Head of the Department Computer Science PES University Electronic City Bangalore for his expertise and guidance throughout all aspects of our study and his help in testing and writing the manuscript.

The system proposed in this paper is a solution for unfastening screws to help automate disassembly of electronic devices or e-waste using a Robotic Arm. We see a new variety of Electronic Devices coming into market every day, and all these products have short life. They also have uncertainties when it comes to their disassembly after the end of product life. The intention of product disassembly is to minimize value loss at the end of product life. This project makes use of a SCARA robotic arm with 5 DOF to be used for the automatic disassembly of old electronic devices. The idea is to detect the type of the screw from its overhead image as seen by the arm and pick an appropriate driver and unfasten the screw using the driver. This is achieved using the Robot Operating System (ROS), a framework that acts as an meta-operating system to interface the robot. A robotic arm of Scara type was designed for this purpose with a suitable gripper using Autodesk Fusion 360. The arm is capable of detecting and classifying the screws using Yolo V5, a machine learning model. © 2023 IEEE.",MoveIt; ROS; SCARA; Screw Removal; YOLOv5,Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Robotic arms; Thermoelectric equipment; Wastes; Automatic disassembly; Disassembly process; E-wastes; Electronics devices; Moveit; Product life; SCARA; Screw removal; Uncertainty; YOLOv5; Screws,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

The materials used for gears range from metal to polymer composite materials. Composite materials are widely used in structures with weight as a critical factor, especially in aerospace industry and in many other industries. Recently, additive manufacturing technology has gained lot of importance in making composite materials. The amount of power transmitted by gears mainly depends on the bending strength of gear tooth. This paper deals with experimental determination of bending stress in teeth of 3D printed gear. The main purpose of the test is to determine the maximum tensile bending stress developed in gear using single tooth specimen. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",3D printed gear; Additive manufacturing; Bending strength,Additives; Aerospace industry; Bending strength; Composite materials; Gear teeth; 3d printed gear; Additive manufacturing technology; Bending stress; Composites material; Critical factors; Experimental determination; Polymer composites materials; Power; Single tooth; Tensile bending stress; 3D printing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anand, S.A.M.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: megha1914@gmail.com",Maurya A.Srivastava A.K.Pandey S.M.Jha P.K.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,21954356,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

ADHD is heterogeneous by nature with subjects exhibiting various combinations of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. ADHD typically persists into adulthood and increases the likelihood of diverse mental health issues and comorbid disorders such as depression, anxiety and learning disabilities. The ramifications of ADHD may worsen with age. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the diagnosis of ADHD from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) images using Capsule Network paired with LSTM Network. Combining the predictions of the Capsule Network along with the LSTM Network with the help of a voting classifier ensures that both aspects of the data - the sequential features for every subject’s scan from the LSTM Network along with the attributes of the entire scan itself from the Capsule Network can be combined to fill in some gaps between each of their predictions and give a better prediction as a whole. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 80% on the KKI dataset and 73.33% on Peking-I dataset which is an improvement over the existing approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; Capsule Network; Deep Learning; LSTM Network; Machine Learning,Long short-term memory; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Capsule network; Deep learning; fMRI data; Health issues; Learning disabilities; LSTM network; Machine-learning; Mental health; Young children; Forecasting,"CM/JIN/2021-015, PIUAH21/IA-016, PIUAH22/IA-037; T2EDK-03048, T2EDK-1346; FPU21/01074, PID2019–106758GB–C33; 31920210133; FCT/UID/CEC/0027/2020; Z20062; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 769288; Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, CGF; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT: SFRH/BD/07344/2020, UIDB/00027/2020; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Eusko Jaurlaritza; Stiftelsen för Kunskaps- och Kompetensutveckling, KKS: 20220068; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: IT1284-19, TIN2017-85827-P; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 140254/2021-8; Papua New Guinea University of Technology; Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: MICINN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2020-113118RB-C31, PID2020-115995RB-I00; University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF: MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SBPLY/21/ 180225/000062; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI: PID2020-115401GB-I00, PID2020-117890RB-I00; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM; Universidad de León, ULE","Funding.

Substantial fuel efficiency enhancements may be made, nevertheless, if these values are controlled by variable valve timing (VVT) systems that can be adjusted in response to the crankshaft’s angular displacement. The main issues with VVT cam systems, however, stem from the noise and wear brought on by high contact velocities during valve opening and closure. The valve actuators for these kinds of applications now predominantly rely on resonant spring arrangements to provide the necessary valve dynamics, which is another significant issue. In the absence of a completely flexible valve actuation system, this results in a fixed amplitude of the valve trajectory and merely permits variable valve timing. In the current study, an effort is made to develop a novel “TRI-LOBED-CAM” mechanism that may be utilized in conjunction with an established cam operating mechanism to axially move the camshaft via a tiny displacement in response to the engine’s operating circumstances, namely, maximum valve displacement at high loads and high engine speeds, minimum valve displacement at lean loads and low engine speeds, and medium valve displacement at intermediate loads. The article outlines an alternative technique for assessing the performance of newly created Tri-lobed cam mechanisms with 8o and 9o taper turns on internal combustion engines. This is used to compare the performance of newly created and commercially available IC engines and determine the effectiveness of the technical solution that is being suggested. © 2023, Books and Journals Private Ltd..

Understanding the reasons behind such variation could help in developing suitable management strategies. Methods: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of incidence and mortality rates on 2,331,363 cases and 46,239 deaths over a cumulative period of approximately 6.5 months from February to August 2020 across 411 districts of India in the age group 15-49. Together with health data from government surveys, we identify risk and protective factors across regions, socio-economic status, literacy, and sex. To obtain common indicators, we apply both machine learning techniques and statistical tests on different health factors. We also identify positive and negative correlates at multiple population scales by dividing the cohort into sub-cohorts formed from two Indian states that were further segregated by sex. Results: We show that males and females differ in their risk factors for mortality. While obesity (lasso regression coefficient: KA=0.5083, TN=0.318) is the highest risk factor for males, anemia (KA=0.3048, TN=0.046) is the highest risk factor for females. Further, anemia (KA=-0.0958, TN=-0.2104) is a protective factor for males, while obesity (KA=-0.0223, TN=-0.3081) is a protective factor for females. Conclusion: Districts with a high prevalence of obesity pose a significantly greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in males. On the other hand, in females, the prevalence of anemia in districts is notably associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. It is important to consider sex-wise heterogeneity in health factors for better management of health resources. © 2023, Bentham Science Publishers.

With resources from top universities like Stanford and MIT, students have access to an immense wealth of educational videos and other material. However, the majority of these resources are in English, creating a language barrier that prevents non-native speakers from utilizing them effectively. In addition, Indic languages have very limited educational resources available online and manual dubbing of videos is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Automated subtitling is not a feasible alternative either, as reading Kannada subtitles alongside English videos can be strenuous. To address these issues, a system is needed that can dub English videos into a specific target language. The focus of this work is on developing such a system for Kannada. The proposed solution is an exhaustive audio-visual system that generates Kannada videos from English videos with accurate lip synchronization, even in dynamic environments, with any kind of face or voice. The system consists of four stages, namely speech-to-text, neural machine translation, text-to-speech, and lip-synchronization. Each component has been evaluated using different metrics, such as Word Error Rate (WER), BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores, and Mean Opinion Score (MOS), based on surveys conducted to test the output. Extensive quantitative evaluations portray that the naturalness of the lip-synced output video is superior to manually dubbed videos, proved by an overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.56. The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize the film industry by replacing the entire manual dubbing process and generating Pan-Global movies. It will also bridge the language gap for people with little or no understanding of English and allow them to access valuable educational resources online in their native language. © 2023 IEEE.",Automatic Speech Recognition; Dubbing; Indic languages; Kannada; Lip synchronization; Neural Machine Translation; Text to Speech; Voice cloning,Character recognition; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; E-learning; Neural machine translation; Speech transmission; Synchronization; Automatic speech recognition; Dubbing; Educational resource; Indic language; Kannada; Lip synchronization; Mean opinion scores; Speech-to-speech translation; Text to speech; Voice cloning; Speech recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Malage, R.V.; PES UniversityIndia; email: ritu172000@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc.

A more sophisticated kind of learning is machine learning (ML), which may be used to identify patterns in the solutions to solve current problems and learn to solve unsolved problems in future. Following the pre-processing of the necessary data, the objective is to learn from the data and identify patterns. The results can then be obtained by applying the patterns found to a different dataset. In general, when using larger, more agile data samples on high-dimensional datasets, ML algorithms can make predictions that are more accurate. Along with the rapid development of bioinformatics, there has been a significant global evolution in drug discovery and design technologies over the past ten years.

During that period, noise was added to the voice signal in order to prevent data breach. Due to advancements in the field of internet, the risk of data breach is ever increasing. This in turn increases the need for secure data transmission. In recent decades, cyber security has been used to shield Internet data from adversaries. This has hence made randomness in data processing an essential part of the security. For a number of years, researchers and scientists have been interested in the field of randomness and chaos. The randomness of the data can be implemented using chaos theory. For voice encryption and decryption, this report uses chaotic circuits. Bhalekar-Gejji system has been used here as the master for encryption and Chen system has been used as the slave. The slave follows the master when the controller is turned on and hence the decrypted voice signal is obtained back.

The traditional laboratory testing methods are inefficient for detecting diseases in crops such as cassava. Unlike rice and maize, cassava is the third-largest source of carbohydrates. It is nutritious, it consists of resistant starch and its root is high in vitamin C. These plants suffer from four major diseases which spread to neighboring cassava plants and affect the cultivation. This paper describes the work done to detect and classify the disease, which will help in figuring out if the crop is healthy and can prevent further spread of disease. Computer vision is a subset of deep learning, which trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

This is especially true for literary works of classical poets like Kaalidasa that employ intricate, often conflicting themes which tend to be particularly tedious to interpret and decipher. The beauty of these works of art tends to get lost in translation. A visual representation in the form of images corresponding to the various themes in the poetry, greatly aids in providing a clearer understanding of the meaning and imagery described. The main aim here is to make classical poetry more accessible by generating detailed images that capture and depict the metaphors and themes used in various works of literature. The core task in this paper is to employ novel machine learning (NLP) techniques to detect and extract the central themes and keywords from the poems that encapsulate the essence of the literary work. This is done using transformer models fine-tuned specifically on a summarization dataset, that generate an abstractive summary of the segment of input text. Maintaining context while doing so is essential to the accuracy of the images being generated. Further, this summary is then provided as an input to a Latent Diffusion Model to generate detailed images corresponding to the poetry. The goal of the project is to make it easier to consume and enjoy classical works of literature by providing additional context and information in the form of images complementing the poetry. © 2023 IEEE.",Abstractive Summarisation; accompanying images; comprehension; Computed Relevance; diffusion processes; Human Evaluation; imagery; Latent Diffusion Models; memory; optically satisfying; poetry; relevance; semantic structure; semantics; significance; Text Simplification; Transformers; Visual Relevance,Diffusion; Abstractive summarization; Accompanying image; Comprehension; Computed relevance; Diffusion model; Diffusion process; Human evaluation; Imagery; Latent diffusion model; Optically satisfying; Poetry; Relevance; Semantic structures; Significance; Text simplification; Transformer; Visual relevance; Semantics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The main intention of the research study is to assist farmers in making decisions while growing crops by providing suggestions based on predictions of machine learning models. Decisions regarding what actions to be performed during different phases of farming is crucial in order to get better yield. It might also help those who are new to farming. Getting real time weather data or forecast is also done using OpenWeatherMap API when it comes to crop recommendation. Fertilizer suggestion works on a simple technique of comparison between existing data and user input where user inputs values of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The predefined dictionary has the suggestions to display based on results of comparison. The third functionality of this system is that it predicts what disease has been caught in tomato plants. Thousands of leaf images have been gathered to train the model of ten different classes. Hence it is limited to tomato crops only. Concepts of convolution neural networks and ResNet architecture have been implemented to deal with vanishing gradient problems.

Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to answer questions asked by the user on a paragraph from a knowledge graph (KG). A strongly connected KG is essential in picking out answers for the requested question. This is because the KG is traversed to select the answer. A well connected KG thus provides a relevant answer. The knowledge graph is built by identifying the subject, the object and the relation for every sentence in the input text or knowledge base. Questions are processed to identify the source-relation-target triples which are then matched with that of the triples forming the KG. The challenge is in extracting the entities and relations between them to create the KG. The model's performance is directly proportional to the strength of the KG. Hence, the presence of a well connected KG provides great accuracy while a poorly connected one would break the system.The proposed model is tested on a Multi RC dataset. Multi RC is a dataset for multi hop question answering that includes short paragraphs and multi-sentence questions. This allows catering to both single hop and multi hop questions. The primary objective was to build a question answering system with the ability to answer multi hop questions together with an efficient response time through the usage of knowledge graphs. A novel approach has been employed where natural language questions are processed into key-value pairs, by leveraging python modules whose dependencies aid in parts of speech tagging in the English language thereby mapping back to the data entities present in the KG to retrieve the correct answer. © 2023 IEEE.",Knowledge graph; Multi hop; Question answering; Single hop,Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Knowledge graphs; Modeling performance; Multi-hops; Natural language questions; Natural languages; Primary objective; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Single hop; Strongly connected; Knowledge graph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

We derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities of three hybrid relaying techniques, namely, hybrid decode-and amplify-And-forward (HDAF), incremental HDAF (IHADF) and IHDAF with maximal ratio combining (MRC) protocols. The HDAF protocol overcomes the limitations of decode-And-forward (DF) and amplify-And-forward (AF) protocols, by combining the advantages of both. In IHDAF protocol, the advantage of successful decoding at the receiver is exploited using the direct link between source and destination nodes, with the added benefit due to HDAF. Through an extensive simulation study, we (a) validate our analysis, (b) show that IHDAF-MRC outperforms IHDAF, HDAF, DF and AF, and (c) CR NOMA outperforms SS NOMA when IHDAF-MRC scheme is employed. © 2020 IEEE.",Cooperative relaying; hybrid relaying protocols; maximal ratio combining; non-orthogonal multiple access; power line communication,Carrier transmission on power lines; Cooperative communication; Relay control systems; Cooperative relaying; Hybrid relaying protocol; Maximal-ratio combining; Multiple access; Non-orthogonal; Non-orthogonal multiple access; Power line communication; Power lines; Power systems reliability; Receiver; Relay; Relaying protocols; Symbol; Decoding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Muhaidat, S.; Khalifa University, United Arab Emirates; email: muhaidat@ieee.org",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2644125X,,,,English,IEEE open J.

The detection of botnet attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become crucial now more than ever due to the frequentemergence of newer botnets and botnet attacks. Techniques used in the recent past have been unable to detectemerging botnets and have focused primarily on botnet families that are already present. The paper overcomes this challenge by detecting emerging and newer botnets using an anomaly detection model as well as generating a new dataset that incorporates unknown IoT attack traffic. Furthermore, techniques used recently have incorporated multiple models to detect IoT botnet attacks. The paper proposes an approach whereby a consolidated model is used to perform the detection of binary, botnet and attack types simultaneously, making it a more efficient approach which is implemented in two phases. A dataset has been generated by simulating an unknown IoT attack (an attack similar to typical IoT botnet attacks) in a virtualized environment. The first phase involves anomaly detection of unknown IoT attacks using an Autoencoder. The second phase consists of multi-output classification of the remaining detected known data using a Multi-Output Deep Neural Network (DNN) into botnet and attack types. Hence, the proposed approach overcomes the problem of detecting unknown or newer botnet attacks. Moreover, the approach performs multi-output classification with 99.99%, 99.98%, and 88.89% accuracies for binary type, botnet type, and attack type respectively. © 2023 IEEE.",Anomaly Detection; Autoencoder; Botnet; Dataset Generation; Internet of Things; Multi-Output Classification; Multi-Output Deep Neural Network,Anomaly detection; Botnet; Deep neural networks; Denial-of-service attack; Internet of things; Learning systems; Network security; Virtual reality; Anomaly detection; Auto encoders; Botnets; Dataset generation; Denialof- service attacks; Distributed denial of service; Multi-output; Multi-output classification; Multi-output deep neural network; Classification (of information),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Despite the extensive research done on object detection and segmentation, only a few studies have explored the effectiveness of popular models such as mask R-CNN, yolo, Vit for Indian dataset. The unstructured nature of Indian roads along with high occlusion and varying lighting, different shape and colors of the vehicle presents a unique challenge to the task of object segmentation on Indian roads. This study explores the uses of two object segmentation models, Mask Scoring R-CNN [7] and Cascade Mask R-CNN [8] for multi object segmentation on Indian roads using the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Specifically, we provide a comprehensive analytical framework and propose a novel energy-based N-GSSK detector for the reliable realization of N-GSSK systems. The proposed receiver is energy-efficient and enjoys low complexity, as it exploits the energy of the received signals and does not require the knowledge of NOMA signals. To quantify its efficiency, we further investigate the performance of the proposed detector in terms of pairwise error probability, bit error rate union bound, and achievable rate. The accuracy of the developed mathematical framework is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which show that N-GSSK outperforms conventional NOMA and GSSK, particularly in terms of spectral efficiency. © 2020 IEEE.",Achievable rate; energy-efficient detection; error rate; generalized space shift keying; non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA); pairwise error probability (PEP); spectral efficiency,Bit error rate; Block codes; Energy efficiency; Error detection; Intelligent systems; MIMO systems; Monte Carlo methods; Spectrum efficiency; Trellis codes; Achievable rate; Bit-error rate; Efficient detection; Energy efficient; Energy-efficient detection; Error rate; Generalized space shift keying; Multiple access; Non-orthogonal; Non-orthogonal multiple access; Pairwise error probability; Shift keying; Space shift; Spectral efficiencies; Transmitting antenna; Antennas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Muhaidat, S.; Khalifa University, United Arab Emirates; email: muhaidat@ieee.org",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,26441330,,,,English,IEEE Open J.

It directly impacts the economy by increasing travel time and affecting the environment by excessive fuel consumption and emission. Road route recommendation to overcome the congestion by alternative route suggestions has gained high importance. The existing route recommendation systems are proposed using the reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning). The techniques suggested in this paper are state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) algorithm and dynamic programming (DP) to guide the commuters to reach the destination with an optimal solution. The algorithm considers travel time, cost, flexibility, and traffic intensity as the user preference attributes to recommend an optimal route. The recommended system is implemented by building a road network graph. We assign values to each user preference attribute along the edges, which can take high(1) or low(0) values. By considering these values, the system recommends the route. The proposed system performance is evaluated based on computation time, cumulative reward, and accuracy. The results show that DP outperforms the SARSA algorithm. © 2022 Northeastern University, China.",dynamic programming; Intelligent transport system; machine learning techniques in ITS; route guidance system; SARSA algorithm; travel time prediction; traveller information system,Fuel economy; Information use; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Motor transportation; Reinforcement learning; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Intelligent transport; Intelligent transport system; Machine learning technique in ITS; Machine learning techniques; Route guidance systems; State-action-reward-state-action algorithm; Transport systems; Travel time prediction; Traveller information systems; User's preferences; Dynamic programming,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ravish, R.; PES UniversityIndia; email: rooparavish@pes.edu",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,23307706,,,,English,J.

More malware is being disseminated online as new technology is developed. The prevalence of botnets has increased. Infected software first creates a botnet before spreading the bot throughout a network. A botnet is employed in scenarios with infected massive computers. Ethical hacking instructors issue a warning due to the botnet's ability to infect vast numbers of computers. Cybersecurity is increasingly relying on botnets. Botnets attack the vast majority of enterprises. To tackle this issue, researchers began to use machine learning (ML).We give a quick review of the various machine learning (ML) techniques used in botnet identification in this study. This paper's main goal is to undertake various malware analysis to build our botnet, analyze it using a packet-capturing tool, and further validate our machine-learning models utilizing the botnet.

Everything that a person needs is available on online platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart. There is no dearth in the quantity and categories of products available on these online platforms. Given this influx of products in these online marketplaces and the rapid shift shown by people toward online shopping, it becomes imperative for an efficient product recommendation system to be in place in order to make product recommendations for a user as effective and seamless as possible. In this paper, a method for a recommendation system that is based on the aspects present in the user inputs and reviews is proposed, implemented, and evaluated. As opposed to just depending on user ratings and the sentiment scores and orientation (positive versus negative) of user reviews to recommend products, the proposed method performs aspect extraction of the given user reviews, calculates the sentiment associated with the aspects along with its positive and negative connotation and orientation and based on this, recommends relevant products to the user as per the requirements entered by the user in our system. The classifiers used for this purpose are k-NN, SVM, SentiWordNet, and NLTK VADER. Thus, based on the product requirements entered by the end user in our recommendation system, relevant products are recommended to the user. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Aspect based; Classification; Recommendation system; Reviews; Sentiment analysis,Electronic commerce; Nearest neighbor search; Recommender systems; Support vector machines; Aspect based; Online marketplaces; Online platforms; Online shopping; Product recommendation; Product recommendation system; Rapid shifts; Sentiment analysis; User input; User reviews; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kamath, K.A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: kamathanjali1999@gmail.com",Sharma N.Sharma N.Goje A.Chakrabarti A.Bruckstein A.M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78982E+12,,,English,Lect.

As a whole, automatic summarization can be split into two broad categories - extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization implies that important and relevant sentences are picked from the article as is, and inserted in the summary. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, requires contextual understanding of the document, and rearranging and shortening the sentences, while maintaining the core essence of the article. Multiple algorithms have been proposed for both these classes of automatic summarization. In the recent past, the emergence of pre-trained language models for NLP tasks have been heralded by the creation of attention mechanisms and Transformers. These models implement encoder-decoder structures, and have far wider applications than previously utilised algorithms. Four such pretrained models are - BERT, BART, XLNet and GPT-2. In this project, we use transfer learning to fit these models on our corpus of Medium articles, fine-tuning them for the task of summarization. Further, we generate online summaries of the data, and use ROUGE metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the model-generated summaries alongside those. We also implement the popular Word2Vec model on the same data, and compare its result with the ones obtained from the attention based models, once again using ROUGE metrics. In addition, we explore the effectiveness of a hybrid approach to the summarization task, by using different combinations of the models on the same article to investigate the results of the same. © 2023 IEEE.",attention mechanism; automatic summarization; BART; BERT; GPT-2; hybrid model; language model; machine learning; natural language processing; word2vec; XLNet,Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Attention mechanisms; Automatic summarization; BART; BERT; GPT-2; Hybrid model; Language model; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Word2vec; XLNet; Natural language processing systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Winter Summit Smart Comput.

This paper aims at producing a rough 2-dimensional animation from the short story texts for a better understanding of the short stories by the user and for the animation creators to develop the videos from story write-ups. The model developed visualizes an English language story, which is given as input, using 2-Dimensional Animation, to make learning and consuming content much easier and more efficient. Extraction of essential information from the story is done to create an animation using PyGame. Simple short stories are fed as input and the output is a rough visualization of the text in video format. The user inputs the story to the model, the story gets pre-processed, and intermediate output is generated. This is done through a module that extracts dialogues and assigns them to the respective subjects. The information extracted is then passed to the animate module which animates the subject accordingly, along with the appropriate dialogue. © 2023 IEEE.",Animation Generation; Artificial Intelligence; Coreference Resolution; GUI; Natural Language Processing; PyGame; Sprite Set; Story Analysis; Subject-Verb; Tkinter; Visualization,Animation; Natural language processing systems; Animation generation; Coreference resolution; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Pygame; Sprite set; Story analyse; Subject-verb; Tkinter; Visualization,,,,,,,,,,,,"Das, S.; PES University, India; email: dassayonika@gmail.com",Kumar A.Mishra V.P.Naranje V.Yadav A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc.

The price of Bitcoin has gone through several cycles of highs and lows. As a result, it is a widely discussed topic, especially on platforms like Twitter. Sentiment analysis is a research area of Natural Language Processing. It is used to determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. Twitter tweets are more challenging to analyze when compared to other forms of text, due to the presence of irregular grammar, emoticons, and sarcasm. This study intends to analyze the effect of tweets on the stock price of Bitcoin. In order to study the effect, the sentiment associated with each tweet is calculated using VADER, and also the profession and follower count associated with verified users who tweet about bitcoin is found. Following this, a model is trained and tested using a combined dataset of tweet related data and historical bitcoin price data. It was found that the sentiment of tweets does correlate with the shift in the price of bitcoin. © 2023 IEEE.",Bitcoin; Linear regression; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter; Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner,Bitcoin; Social networking (online); Language processing; Natural languages; Positive/negative; Price prediction; Reasoners; Research areas; Sentiment analysis; Stock price; Twitter; Valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

This article has developed a shopping cart with weight sensors built into the cart to measure the load of the product, and an android application with deep learning models(MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetV2) to classify the required item. The models were trained on a custom-built dataset with 51 classes. The mobile phone camera is used to capture an image of the product. The models are used to classify this item. Once the item is classified, the weight of the item is obtained from the load cells. A database analysis is performed to obtain the price of the item. With these details, the bill is generated as soon as the user is done with shopping without waiting in long queues. © 2023 IEEE.",Android; Automation; Databases; Deep Neural Networks; IOT; Shopping; Weight Sensors,Android (operating system); Automation; Internet of things; Queueing theory; Android; Android applications; IOT; Learning models; Manual labors; Mobile phone cameras; Shopping; Shopping carts; Time-spent; Weight sensors; Deep neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The availability of high-resolution data by Sentinel-2 multispectral products makes implementing remote sensing applications feasible. However, overutilizing or underutilizing multispectral bands of the product can lead to inferior performance. In this work, we compare the performances of ten out of the thirteen bands available in a Sentinel-2 product for water segmentation using eight machine learning algorithms. We find that the shortwave-infrared bands (B11 and B12) are the most superior for segmenting water bodies. B11 achieves an overall accuracy of 71 % while B12 achieves 69 % across all algorithms on the test site. We also find that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is the most favorable for single-band water segmentation. The SVM achieves an overall accuracy of 69 % across the tested bands over the given test site. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of choosing the right amount of data, we use only B11 reflectance data to train an artificial neural network, BandNet. Even with a basic architecture, BandNet is proportionate to known architectures for semantic and water segmentation, achieving a 92.47 mIOU on the test site. BandNet requires only a fraction of the time and resources to train and run inference, making it suitable to be deployed on web applications to run and monitor water bodies in localized regions.

Videos are a rich source of information with the multi-modal data forms of images, audio, and optionally subtitles blended. Current research is going on in combining these individual domains which have given rise to topics such as image captioning, visual question answering, and video question answering. Video Question Answering is a model which combines research topics like object detection and recognition, temporal information processing, visual attention, and natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a model with Attention Mechanism for Video Question Answering that assigns varying weights to the many pieces of information the video encompasses. The model combines the question with 3 streams i.e., video’s frames, subtitles, and objects to get the most probable answer. The model also receives the set of answer candidates as input and predicts one of them as the most probable answer since it has been trained and tested on the TVQA dataset. © 2023 by the authors.

There are various types of the routing attacks like the blackhole attack, selective forwarding, sinkhole attack, wormhole attack, and decreased rank attack. Other attacks such as version number modification, hello flooding attack, and Sybil attack are considered resource depletion attacks. These attacks can be designed in a way to corrupt information, reduce bandwidth, and threaten the integrity of the network which is why it is critical to identify the attacks and avoid as much damage as possible to the network. In this paper, we will be focusing on some of the attacks mentioned above. We have proposed a methodology to detect and predict IoT attacks. We propose different machine learning algorithms and conclude which algorithm is the most accurate in detecting every attack. The paper primarily focuses on dataset creation, followed by implementing various machine learning algorithms and identifying if a network is under attack and then what attack is taking place in that scenario. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Contiki OS; Cooja simulator; Internet of Things (IoT); Isolation attack; Low-power lossy networks; Routing protocol; RPL attacks; Sinkhole attack,Computer crime; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Learning algorithms; Low power electronics; Machine learning; Contiki; Contiki OS; Cooja simulator; Internet of thing; Isolation attack; Lossy networks; Low Power; Low-power lossy network; Routing-protocol; RPL attack; Sinkhole attack; Routing protocols,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goyal, A.; Department of Computer Science, PES University Electronic City Campus, Hosur Rd, Konappana Agrahara, Electronic City, Karnataka, India; email: abhishek333goyal@gmail.com",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23674512,,,,English,Lecture.

The flow-anchored equations are computed by assuming a low Reynolds number and long wavelength deliberations. The solution of the mathematical framework is heeded analytically by using Bernoulli’s rule of integration technique for velocity and temperature distribution, volume flow rate, and pressure rise. Pumping characteristics are studied based on different pressure ranges. The dynamics of various coherent parameters are deliberated through graphical elucidation. In fluid transmission, an interesting phenomenon is trapping in which a bolus is transported with the speed of the wave and this trapped bolus is pushed forward along the peristaltic wave. This trapping mechanism is visualized with the aid of contour plots and reveals that the size of the trapped bolus shows opposite behavior in both cases by increasing the viscosity parameter. The current inquiry is also designated for Newtonian fluid as a special case. The novelty of this work is to explain the Jeffrey fluid model which is capable of describing stress relaxation properties that normally lag in viscous fluids, thus this article clearly demonstrated the importance of choosing variable viscosity according to the requirement of the concerned fields. The outcome of this investigation can as well aid in understanding the transport phenomena in the human physiological system. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",heat transfer; Jeffrey fluid; particle fluid suspension; peristaltic motion; variable viscosity,Newtonian liquids; Reynolds number; Stress relaxation; Suspensions (fluids); Temperature distribution; Viscosity; Bernoulli; Distribution volume; Integration techniques; Jeffreys fluids; Long wavelength; Low Reynolds number; Mathematical frameworks; Particle-fluid suspension; Peristaltic motion; Variable viscosity; Heat transfer,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madhura, K.R.; Post Graduate Department of Mathematics, India; email: madhurakrmadhu@gmail.com",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1430750,,IJAED,,English,Int J Ambient Energy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161443810,,,,,,,

With a rapid increase in data available on the internet, one's research can easily be swayed as there is a high probability of less important papers being displayed as search results. A significant percentage of research papers published lack credibility thus leading to an overall decline in the standard of research. With the objective of making the methodology of research straightforward and providing academia with essential and accurate information, we propose a system with the application of Knowledge Graphs. We utilized the Aminer(v13) dataset for the creation of the Knowledge Graph. We have introduced a novel scoring approach, 'Node Importance Score' (NIS), for research papers using graph centrality measures i.e., PageRank, EigenVector Centrality, and Betweenness Centrality, which is combined with the H-Index of the publication of the paper. This score is used to find the top-k influential and important papers in a given domain. Validation of the obtained NIS shows that our approach overcomes certain flaws present in the state-of-the-art scoring system. © 2023 IEEE.",Influential Node; Neo4j; Scientific Knowledge Graph; Topic Modeling,Graph theory; High probability; Influential nodes; Knowledge graphs; Neo4j; Node importance; Research papers; Scientific knowledge; Scientific knowledge graph; Time-intensive process; Topic Modeling; Knowledge graph,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kalla, A.; PES UniversityIndia; email: aparnakalla11@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The most efficient way to improve road safety would be to consider the driver factor since it has been found that over 90% of all road accidents are due to driver's fault. The emotion of the driver plays a crucial role in ensuring safety while driving. While external parameters can help improve safety, these external parameters are not of much help unless the driver is emotionally stable. Thus, detecting the driver's emotion and enhancing it could significantly improve road safety. Hence, this paper involves identifying and improving the emotional stability of drivers in order to drastically raise automobile safety. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have helped automate and improve many aspects of driving, and have created an environment with a comfortable passenger experience. This paper intends to use some of these AI technologies to detect the emotional state of the driver as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fear, Disgust or Neutral by considering both speech and facial expressions, and then generate alerts based on the detected emotion which includes audio and visual alerts for safety, and finally improve the driver's emotional state using appropriate suggestions provided by a music recommendation system. This study makes use of deep learning models (i.e., CNN Models) for automatic emotion detection from audio and video where the validation accuracy obtained for video emotion detection and audio emotion detection is 83% and 78% respectively. The paper also details the use of a developed algorithm for combination of the emotions from Audio and Video. Furthermore, this study uses the Spotify API for the music recommendation system. © 2023 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence (AI); Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Deep Learning; Safety,Accident prevention; Accidents; Deep learning; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Recommender systems; Roads and streets; Safety factor; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence technologies; Audio and video; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Emotion detection; Emotional state; Music Recommendation System; Road safety; Emotion Recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,"Giri, M.; PES University, India; email: moyank110@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The model designed is rated by the accuracy in predicting future values. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the models is not satisfactory. The presence of different domains requires various data optimization techniques to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. For any predictive analyst, there exists a high correlation between the learning model and the input data. Moreover, the optimization level of the machine learning algorithm is characterized by its speed, accuracy, training time, the volume of data, and implementation level. Hence, for a data scientist, it is a difficult task to decide the granularity of the algorithm on training data considering the issues related to data quality viz, missing values or errors in input data set, presence of textual or Boolean values in data set, an improper number of domains than required, non-uniformity in the features. In general, machine learning systems are considered black boxes even to the research community that builds them. This makes it hard for them to access the results. In this paper, the main focus is laid on testing the quality of training data through a proposed framework. The framework will be designed in line with the aspects of a machine learning model to be tested based on the quality of data, quality of features, and quality of algorithms. © 2023 IEEE.",Accuracy; Machine Learning; Prediction; Quality of algorithms; Quality of features,Input output programs; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Accuracy; Data quality; Data set; Different domains; Input datas; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Quality of algorithm; Quality of feature; Training data; Forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vinodha, K.; PES University-ECC, India; email: vinodhak@pes.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

With the advent of social media and networking, tweets of various kinds are being posted by people without a check for what is really true or not. What one reads on Twitter may not be fully authentic as there is no authentication of tweets that happens. People are free to post any tweet of their choice. There are 6 different categories for the user to choose from-Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Business, Technology, and Health. The user can choose at most 3 categories to get tweets. The approach builds a system that would automate the recommendation of authentic tweets using Twitter as the source. This is done by extracting trending tweets from Twitter and then filtering out the fake tweets if any.

A system which can classify the type of tumour will be very useful for the whole process of diagnosing. This system takes an MRI scan of image of the brain diagnosed with a tumour as an input and outputs whether the tumour is a Glioma, Meningioma or Pituitary based on selected features. Glioma is a tumour that develops in the brain and spinal cord. Meningioma is a tumour that develops on the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord inside the skull and a pituitary tumour, is a tumour that forms in the pituitary gland near the brain that can cause changes in hormone levels in the body. We use various features and kernels to classify if the tumours are glioma, meningioma or pituitary. © 2023 IEEE.",Brain Tumour; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Kernel Networks,Brain; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Brain tumor classifications; Brain tumors; Images processing; Kernel machine; Medical images processing; Meningiomas; MRI scan; Neural kernel network; Research areas; Spinal-cord; Tumors,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chauhan, S.; PES UniversityIndia; email: sushantpeace10@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Autonomous Vehicles are no exception to the same. Leading companies such as Bosch, Tesla, Audi, and Toyota are working actively to improve the customer experience of autonomous vehicles on the road. Therefore, the issue of reliability over the technology and passenger safety becomes an essential issue. At the same time, the presence of potholes over roads in urban cities remains a persistent concern for the safety of road vehicles and their passengers. It thus gives rise to the need to develop technologies to ensure swift mobility of autonomous vehicles around the potholes to ensure improved customer feedback. Hence, this paper proposes a viable system based on modulating the speed and positioning of the autonomous vehicle, staying within the lane upon detecting a potential pothole in its course. © 2023 IEEE.",Actuator Interface; Gazebo; Machine Learning; On Board Computer; Pothole Detection; ROS,Landforms; Machine learning; Roads and streets; Actuator interface; Autonomous Vehicles; Detection and avoidances; Gazebo; Industrialisation; Machine-learning; Onboard computers; Pothole detection; ROS; Vehicle system; Autonomous vehicles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This work aims to create a real-time adaptive venue recommendation system by integrating three dimensions -user locations, personal preferences, and the venue's personality. The final solution space will contain a selection of venues as suggestions to the group. These venues will be convenient for all individuals present in the group in terms of travel time, distance to be travelled, and personal preferences. The proposed approach works at three levels. First, an adaptive K-means clustering algorithm is used to analyze individual locations in real time and determine a convenient geographic range around a centroid. Secondly, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is used for personality classification, mapping user personalities to venue personalities with an accuracy of 84%. Finally, venues within the designated geographic range are mapped to the group of individuals and suggested as options. The system was tested with sample groups and yielded positive results for venue suggestions. This approach aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for selecting an appropriate venue for a diverse group of individuals by considering their locations, personal preferences, and venue personalities in real time. © 2023 IEEE.",Adaptive K-means; Personality Classification; Real-Time recommendation; Venue-based Recommender system,Intelligent systems; K-means clustering; Location; Real time systems; Travel time; Adaptive K-mean; Geographic ranges; K-means; Personal preferences; Personality classification; Real- time; Real-time recommendation; Travel-time; User personalities; Venue-based recommende system; Recommender systems,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sengar, P.; PES UniversityIndia; email: prachisengar.7@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

This paper aims to make identity security risk-based and hence adaptive by devising risk-scoring algorithms for five real-time use cases in detail. Zero-trust security principles are incorporated by continually collecting sign-in logs and analyzing them to check for any suspicious activities or anomalies to make it a dynamic approach. Based on the risk scores calculated users are segregated as risky and non-risky. While many adaptive authentication approaches have been proposed, the identities are confined just to users. Moreover, they lack emphasis on practical risk evaluation techniques. This work considers devices as an identity too and categorizes them as registered and unregistered devices. Further, results are made available to security administrators by displaying them on a dashboard for them to analyze and make necessary decisions like mitigation, multi-level authentication, or any other access control policies as such. © 2023 IEEE.",Adaptive; Dynamic access control; Health-posture; Identities; Risk-based authentication; zero trust principles,Authorization; Health risks; Adaptive; Dynamic access control; Health-posture; Identity; Identity-based; Remote access; Risk-based; Risk-based authentication; Threats and attacks; Zero trust principle; Authentication,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dasu, L.S.; PES University, India; email: dasusravanti@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The system utilizes the open-source software Gpredict to determine the azimuth and elevation angles required for tracking a satellite of choice. The Antenna Control Unit designed by us is used to interface the motor control unit of the antenna with the computer system that hosts Gpredict. The Antenna Control Unit, based on the commands, controls the speed and direction of rotation of the azimuth and elevation angles. The antenna is then able to automatically point and track the chosen satellite without human intervention. To ensure proper signal reception, the system also includes a software defined radio based signal recording, demodulation, and decoding module implemented using GQRX and GNU Radio. This approach allows for a cost and space-efficient system while maintaining the necessary functionality. Eight Low Earth Orbit Satellites were tracked with 0.1 degree precision whose downlink frequency ranged from 2200 MHz to 2400 MHz and obtained their frequency spectrum for the entire pass. The proposed system is expected to improve the reliability and efficiency of satellite signal reception in earth stations. © 2023 IEEE.",Antenna Control Unit; Automation; RPi Pico; Satellite Earth Station; Tracking,C (programming language); Computer control systems; Microwave antennas; Open source software; Open systems; Orbits; Parabolic antennas; Satellite antennas; Satellite ground stations; Satellites; Software radio; Tracking (position); Antenna control unit; Azimuth and elevation angles; Control unit; Design and implementations; Open-source softwares; Parabolic dish antenna; RPi pico; Satellite earth stations; Signal reception; Tracking; Automation,,,,,,,,,,,,"Periyapatna, A.R.; PES University, India; email: anirudharam95@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

While predictive models exist for certain common diseases in isolation, there is a need to detect multiple diseases at the same time to ensure that rarer conditions do not go undiagnosed. In the present work, we propose a workflow to detect the presence of seven ocular diseases. We first determine the disease risk using EfficientNetB3 pre-trained on ImageNet. Next, for common diseases with a relatively larger representation of images in the dataset, we utilize a Vanilla CNN to classify each disease. For relatively less common diseases, characterized by fewer representative samples in the dataset, we employ transfer learning using EfficientNetB3 pre-trained on ImageNet. To deal with the class imbalance in the original data, we create representative datasets with respect to each disease.

Simulated annealing (SA) is a thermo-inspired metaheuristic used for solving various engineering and non-engineering problems. SA is also used for the realization and optimization of CLCs. Circuits with a large number of inputs and outputs require more generations for realization. Realization of the optimal circuit with fewer generations is desired as realization time increases with increase in the number of generations. In this paper, an attempt is made to realize circuits using population-based SA with fewer generations. SA with partitioning approach is proposed in this paper for circuits that could not be realized with fewer preset generations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed work, benchmark circuits from LGSynth'91 are considered, and it is observed that the success rate improved and realization time reduced with the proposed partitioning approach. During the evaluation, it is also observed that the gate count was reduced by 2.5–77.39% and the transistor count was reduced by 7.69–95.53% on using proposed work with fewer generations over circuits reported in the literature. © 2023 IETE.",Benchmark circuits; combinational logic circuit; metaheuristic; optimization; partitioning; simulated annealing,Benchmarking; Computer circuits; Logic circuits; Simulated annealing; Basic building block; Benchmark circuit; Combinational logic circuits; Gate levels; Gate transistors; Metaheuristic; On chips; Optimisations; Partitioning; Power; Timing circuits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,3772063,,,,English,IETE J Res,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160750097,,,,,,,

It is both time consuming and labour intensive. As a solution to this problem, the paper proposes a system that automatically evaluates answer booklets, thereby saving time and effort. The proposed method involves using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to automate the evaluation process. The first step is to extract the handwriting from input image files using an existing GCP OCR (Google Cloud Platform-Optical character recognition) text extract model, which has superior accuracy and performance to other models. It also uses various Natural Language Processing techniques such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to extract keywords; and GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Trans-former 3) to summarize long answers. This method has been observed to assign marks that are usually identical to hand-evaluated marks. This paper also proposes a web application that simplifies the process of evaluating answer scripts. The web application generates the text extracted from both the student’s answer and the answer key image files, the summary of the student’s answer and the marks obtained based on the extracted keywords. © Ismail Saritas.

As different sectors make use of different type and parts of coconut, an automated separation of coconut Would aid in faster processing. Thus the major issue faced by these sectors is the automated sorting of coconut into different categories such as Non-Tender Coconut, Tender Whole coconut, Tender coconut cut With flesh and Without flesh. In this Work We have trained and tested a Decision Tree and DenseNet model to automatically classify coconut images into various categories.

Despite recent advances in intensive care technology, conventional techniques are obtrusive and may cause skin abrasion and discomfort during movement in the neonate. Traditional approaches have recently undergone adjustments, such as the use of wireless equipment to replace wired systems, but these modifications have not made the approach less unsafe for the skin of neonates. To address the limitations of previous techniques, this study introduces a novel approach for developing a non-invasive, real-time, low-cost vital monitoring system employing video processing technology. The purpose of this research is to determine how different areas of interest, specifically the forehead and chest, influence heart rate and respiration rate when measured with a webcam. The model uses eulerian video magnification to enlarge the region of interest observed by the haar cascade detector, followed by the use of an imaging photoplethysmogram to detect changes in skin color to estimate heart rate and respiration rate in a situational setting. Using the proposed EVM-iPPG approach, we were able to obtain results that were compared with ground truth acquired from the hospital's vital monitoring system, with mean absolute error of 5.097 for the forehead and 6.494 for the chest when measured for heart rate, and mean absolute error of 3.523 for the forehead and 4.902 for the chest when measured for respiration rate. The forehead showed lower errors than the chest, indicating that it should be the region of focus for vitals estimation. © 2023 IEEE.",Eulerian video magnification; heart rate; imaging-photoplethysmography; neonates; NICU; real-time; respiration rate,Heart; Image segmentation; Intensive care units; Patient monitoring; Photoplethysmography; Video signal processing; Eulerian; Eulerian video magnification; Heart-rate; Imaging-photoplethysmography; Mean absolute error; Monitoring system; Neonate; NICU; Real- time; Respiration rate; Errors,,The authors are grateful to Dr. Eeshwar for his assistance in gathering data for the study from the Siddaganga and Siddaramanna hospitals.

Coriandrum sativum, a well-known Indian herbal medicinal plant, is shown to have antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity. This comparative study focuses on the molecular docking (PyRx v0.9.8) of ligand binding domains of WbpE Aminotransferase involved in O-antigen assembly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3NU7) and Beta-Lactamase found in Staphylococcus aureus (1BLC) with selected phytocompounds of Coriandrum sativum along with a known binder and a clinical reference drug. This was followed by molecular dynamics simulation studies (GROMACS v2019.4) for the docked complexes (with Geranyl acetate) with the best binding affinities (-23.4304 kJ/mol with Beta-Lactamase and −28.4512 kJ/mol with WbpE Aminotransferase) and maximum hydrogen bonds. Molecular dynamics simulation studies for both the proteins demonstrated that the complex with Geranyl acetate showed stability comparable to the complex with reference drug observed via Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and H-bond analyses. Changes in the secondary structural elements indicated that Geranyl acetate could possibly cause improper functioning of WbpE Aminotransferase leading to disrupted cell wall formation. Further, MM/PBSA analyses showed significant binding affinity of Geranyl acetate with WbpE Aminotransferase and Beta-Lactamase. This study aims to provide rationale for further studies of Coriandrum sativum as an antimicrobial, and to contextualise the results in the current scenario of growing antimicrobial resistance. HIGHLIGHTS Phytoconstituents present in Coriandrum sativum show significant binding affinity to the proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Geranyl acetate exhibited the highest binding affinity with WbpE Aminotransferase involved in O-antigen assembly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB ID:3NU7) and Beta-Lactamase found in Staphylococcus aureus (PDB ID: 1BLC) Molecular dynamics simulation analyses show that the phytoconstituent, Geranyl acetate has an effect similar to the clinical reference drug, thus exhibiting potential antibacterial activity.

Two of the most widely studied and built QA systems are Natural Language Question Answering (NLQA) and Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). NLQA relies on sequence learning algorithms, which have limitations on the length of input they can handle, while KGQA relies on the Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) tuple representation of data, which may not always be available in the knowledge graph. In this paper, we present a novel approach for addressing these challenges by utilizing the structural information from the Knowledge Graph (KG) and the semantic information from the Natural Language Context. Due to the lack of a dataset to enable this approach, we propose the creation of a multi-view dataset - MTL-QA, specifically designed for multi-task learning.

Currently, none of the evolutionary approaches available have incorporated the attention mechanism, which is a proven technique to improve the performance of image classification and language models. This paper posits a neuroevolutionary technique coupled with the use of Convolution Block Attention Module for image classification. As technology progresses, it's inevitable that there will be massive advancements leading to cheaper and more available computing making evolutionary approaches a promising avenue to develop task specific deep learning models. The proposed approach evolves a topology that achieves a high fitness of 87.44%, using fewer parameters as compared to previous approaches.

There seems to be no application where the use of deep learning concepts has not been used yet. One such application is the detection of number plates of vehicles on roads. The incidence of automobile crashes has greatly expanded along with the population growth. Their needs to be system that could automatically detect the vehicle's number plate whenever necessary. The situation arises when any of the rider does not obey to the traffic rules, or skips the traffic signals or indulges in any other sort of activities such as accidents. In these situations, the rider tries to run away. In order to detect the person, these kind of deep learning models helps us to detect the vehicle. Image labelers on the roadsides. Need of sensors are required to store the data and they need to be deployed on the roadside. These labelers are used to track the vehicles that are not obeying the traffic rules. With the use of sensors, it could be stated that the use of IoT also plays in the deployment of the current work when it comes to real-time. The model initially is trained with numerous number plates. The number plates have various patterns of texts and numbers and it is essential for the deep learning model to get trained. With successful training, the model is able to detect the new number plates.

The main idea in this technique, called the 2EACRAC2S algorithm, is that a secondary (SU) participates in the CSS procedure only when the path loss between itself and the primary user (PU) exceeds a threshold. Otherwise, it does not carry out SS and refrains from sending the decision to a fusion center (FC), which saves energy. The FC uses the AND fusion rule to combine the decisions from active SUs. Expressions for the achievable throughput, energy consumption and EE of the 2EACRAC2S algorithm are derived. Results based on numerical techniques show that the 2EACRAC2S outperforms CSS technique, in terms of EE. © 2023 IEEE.",Ant colony task assignment; cognitive radios; cooperative spectrum sensing; energy detection; energy efficiency,Ant colony optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Radio systems; Ant colonies; Ant colony task assignment; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cogntive radios; Energy detection; Energy efficient; Fusion center; Sensing algorithms; Spectrum sensing; Tasks assignments; Cognitive radio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,ICRTEC - Proc.: IEEE Int.

The most popular method to extract voice features presently involves using MFCC coefficients which are the statistical features acquired from a kind of Spectral depiction of the audio clip (a nonlinear 'spectrum-of-a-spectrum'). In the Mel scale, the divisions of the frequency band closely mimic the human auditory systems response. Post extraction, the needed features are extracted and the relevant classification or regression models/operations are applied. Numerous deep learning algorithms have been used so far in the studies for age and gender estimation. In this paper, the attempt is the same. A new labeled dataset is built by collecting the audio samples of people belonging to a variety of age groups and two genders (male and female) from the web. To this dataset the MFCC feature extraction program was applied; after extraction, different regression models were used to compute the age of the speakers and classification models to identify their genders. © 2023 IEEE.",Age; CatBoost; Classification; Decision Tree; MFCC; Regression; Stochastic Gradient descent; XGBoost,Audition; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep learning; Gradient methods; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Age; Age estimation; Catboost; Classification models; Human voice; MFCC; Regression; Regression modelling; Stochastic gradient descent; Xgboost; Extraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,ICRTEC - Proc.: IEEE Int.

Sign language recognition has been an active area of research for many years, and there has been progress in both sensor-based and vision-based methods. Sensor-based methods, such as those that use gloves or other wearable devices, have historically been more accurate, but vision-based methods are becoming more prevalent due to their cost-effectiveness. The study aimed to recognize sign language words using hand pictures captured by a web camera. The mediapipe hands method was used to estimate hand landmarks, and features were generated from the distances between the landmarks. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used for character and words classification. The study used its own dataset and it compared different scaling factors, including the distances from positions 0 to 17, 5 to 17, and 0 to 12, to determine which one worked best. The best results were found using the palm size distance (o-9).

A lot of people have started taking up exercises at home and if done incorrectly, they can have major negative effects. Another one of the main contributors to these health issues is bad sitting posture, which is only exacerbated when working for hours on end. Hand gesture detection has many useful applications in elderly healthcare, automating actions and gesture-based presentations and games. To help users with these actions, our paper proposes pinpointing the points of the error to the user in real-time and in a lightweight manner for yoga posture correction. The incorrect positions shall be shown in real-time on top of the user's video feed to help them correct it properly. The user shall be told about when they are sitting in a bad position, and the overall bad posture time will also be shown for the session, which will provide the required information to the user. To further help users in a useful manner, our paper looks to augment the hand gesture detection feature with federated learning and personalization to avoid the common pitfall of privacy concerns, while still allowing users to customize their experience. The proposed library for the implementation of these tasks is the MediaPipe library. This library is one of the key components that makes the features lightweight and easy to use. The aforementioned library also looks to implement the features in real time with no lag while keeping the resource requirements as low as possible. © 2023 IEEE.",Body Posture Correction; Federated Learning; Gesture Detection; MediaPipe; Sitting Posture Correction,Gesture recognition; Body posture correction; Body postures; Federated learning; Gesture detections; Hand gesture; Health issues; Mediapipe; Real- time; Sitting posture; Sitting posture correction; Palmprint recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,"Singhal, R.; PES University, India; email: rijulsinghal63@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

Sensors like MQ2 and MQ135 are used to detect freshness of food. Eclipse IDE, SQLYOG are used to develop the interactive platform. One of the major assumptions made is that the predicted food sensor values are based on samples collected from a few basic food items. It is highly unfeasible to ensure that the classification of food as spoilt or unspoilt is inclusive of all possible food items.

To address this issue, the paper proposes an automated evaluation system that uses DL and NLP techniques. The suggested approach begins by extracting raw text from image files using a proven GCP OCR text extract model, which is well-known for its better accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing methods like BERT and GPT-3 are used to extract keywords and summarize extensive answers. The suggested technique gives marks that are usually comparable to those issued by manual evaluation. Furthermore, the article suggests a web tool that simplifies the evaluation procedure. The application outputs the raw text of student answers and the answer key, a synopsis of the student's response, and the marks gained based on the extracted keywords. © 2023 IEEE.",Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT); Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); GCP OCR (Google Cloud Platform - Optical character recognition); Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3rd generation (GPT-3); Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK); Support Vector Machine (SVM),Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Network coding; Optical character recognition; Support vector machines; 3rd generation; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Boosted decision trees; Cloud platforms; Convolutional neural network; GCP OCR (google cloud platform - optical character recognition); Generative pre-trained transformer 3rd generation; Google+; Gradient-boosted decision tree; Language processing; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing; Natural language toolkit; Natural languages; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chavan, S.M.; PES University, Karnatka, India; email: pes2ug19cs347@pesu.pes.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Int.

A linear modelling algorithm will be more optimal on a linearly separable dataset i.e., the one in which the two classes can be cleanly separated by a linear boundary. Whereas, for a dataset in which the classes are not linearly separable may need a complex kernel-based algorithm to get the job done. A prior idea about the data in terms of the degree of separability of the two classes, is likely to help zoom in on algorithms more suitable than others and in the process reduce model building time, minimize wastage of computational resources. For this, we plan to use a purity metric that helps categorize a dataset into simple, medium, complex (SMC). The value of this metric will be estimated from the underlying distribution characteristics of the data on the various attributes. Simple dataset is the one in which the classes can be linearly separated without any transformations. The purity metric will be high and on the other end of the spectrum, a complex dataset will be the one in which the classes are not linearly separable even after transformations. Such datasets will have low value in purity metric. Further, with the help of boxplots and quantile values, we analyze which model performs better in each category. The paper proposes a set of guidelines to choose an optimal classical Machine Learning algorithm for binary classification. © 2023 IEEE.",classification; computation time; linear separability; optimal algorithm; purity,Computational complexity; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Computation time; Data complexity; Distribution characteristics; Linear modeling; Linear separability; Linearly separable; Model algorithms; Optimal algorithm; Purity; Simple++; Linear transformations,,,,,,,,,,,,,Paul R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"IEEE Annual Comput.

In such a setup, status updates by primary transmitter (PT) and secondary transmitter (ST) have to be designed in an efficient manner. To this end, we derive an expression for the overall average age of information (AoI) of the network, and formulate an optimization problem based on AoI to find optimal status updates. We show that the formulated optimization problem is convex.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, demand for virtual trainers increased. There are current systems that can classify different exercises, and there are other systems that provide feedback on a specific exercise. We propose a system that can simultaneously recognize a pose as well as provide real-time corrective feedback on the performed exercise with the least latency between recognition and correction. In all computer vision techniques implemented so far, occlusion and a lack of labeled data are the most significant problems in correctly detecting and providing helpful feedback. Vector geometry is employed to calculate the angles between key points detected on the body to provide the user with corrective feedback and count the repetitions of each exercise.

The coffee plant has experienced significant damage as a result of a White Stem Borer (WSB) bug. The WSB bores into the coffee stem and stays buried there until the plant fully falls. As it is challenging to diagnose the disease in the early stages of its infestation, this disease greatly distresses coffee growers. In order to find a way to prevent the significant yield loss, we built on a dataset of WSB-infected stems, identified 3 distinct features to classify infected coffee stems and distinguish them from healthy stems, and then trained YoloV5 deep learning model. We developed a model using augmented images from the existing image data after dividing it into training and testing sets. mAP, precision, and recall of 81.9, 89.7 and 73.8 percentages respectively were obtained, which would increase substantially with larger data size. The proposed method of utilising the bark's characteristics for early detection of stem borer disease has not been explored so far. The image processing pipeline implemented is accompanied by the simulation of Arabica Coffee plantationlike environments. The simulations focus on the Jackal UGV as it is an ideal robot for the use case of autonomous deployment in mapping and navigation of the plantations.

We present a study undertaken on the prediction of three parameters that quantify climatic change, namely Land Surface Temperature, Carbon Monoxide, and Precipitation. Since the three parameters are essentially non stationary in nature, the differencing method has been looked at to fine-tune the output of the prediction models. The two seasonal autoregressive models chosen for the study are Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and TBATS, due to non-stationarity of the data. The focus is to predict climate change using predictive models for Indian sub-continent. Region-wise dataset was extracted from Google earth engine using a reducer function. A comparison of the forecasting models using root mean square error and mean absolute scaled error suggests that SARIMA performs better in the case of Land Surface Temperature and Precipitation whereas TBATS performs better for Carbon Monoxide Concentration. © 2023 IEEE.",auto-regressive; climate change; non-stationarity,Atmospheric temperature; Carbon monoxide; Climate models; Forecasting; Land surface temperature; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA); Climatic changes; Global economies; Land surface temperature; Non-stationarities; Predictive models; Remote sensing data; Three parameters; Unpredictable changes; Climate change,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhumika, M.S.; PES UniversityIndia; email: msbhumikaaug21@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

The problem of pose estimation is usually tackled through the usage of stereo cameras and inertial measurement units for obtaining depth and euclidean distance for measurement of points in 3D space. However, the usage of these devices comes with a high signal processing latency as well as a significant monetary cost. By making use of MediaPipe, a framework for building perception pipelines for human pose estimation, the proposed algorithm extracts a quaternion from a 2-D frame capturing an image of a human object at a sub-fifty millisecond latency while also being capable of deployment at edges with a single camera frame and a generally low computational resource availability, especially for use cases involving last-minute detection and reaction by autonomous robots and similarly modelled intelligent transport systems.

Unlike existing works, where the transmission scheduling (i.e., assigning the base stations for each client) and the computation resource scheduling are jointly considered. Due to the uncertainties in the task generation and path losses, we model the scheduling problem as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) problem which maximizes the total utility of the clients. The DRL model (based on actor-critic neural networks) is trained using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

The carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles (CMCH-NPs) were used to deliver budesonide to the colon. The formation of Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCH) was confirmed by H1NMR, FTIR, and degree of substitution (Ds). CMCH-NPs were evaluated for drug excipient interaction, loading efficiency % (LE), entrapment efficiency % (EE), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), zeta potential, particle size distribution, in-vitro release studies (also with enzymes), cytotoxicity, and stability studies. In-vitro release studies by dialysis bag method without enzymes revealed that N4 and N6 showed less than 10% cumulative drug release (% CDR) in pH1.2. SEM results of N6 showed spherical shaped aggregates and smoother surfaces than N4. Consequently, the presence of pepsin in pH 1.2, diastase in pH 4.5 and pancreatin in pH 7.4 buffers did not have any significant effect on the release kinetics of the N6 CMCH-NPs. On addition of the colonic enzymes in 10th hour, there was a marked increase in the release of budesonide (upto 98.27% ± 1.30%) due to the action of enzymes produced by the colonic microflora which causes the lysis of glycosidic bonds. The evidence for pH sensitivity along with the microbiotic activation of the CMCH-NPs in the colon was thus established. The cell viability (%) in all samples was above 96%, ensuring the biocompatibility of CMCH in the dose range of 0.2–2.4 mg/mL. Stability studies as per ICH Q1A (R2) guidelines were found to be stable. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",carboxymethyl chitosan; Colon drug delivery systems; Crohn’s Disease; drug delivery; inflammatory bowel disease; inflammatory bowel disease; inflammatory bowel disease therapy; intermediate colitis; polysaccharides; ulcerative colitis,Biocompatibility; Chitosan; Controlled drug delivery; Disease control; Diseases; Efficiency; Gelation; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Targeted drug delivery; Carboxymethyl chitosan; Chitosan nanoparticles; Colon drug delivery system; Crohn’s disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Inflammatory bowel disease therapy; Intermediate colitis; Ulcerative colitis; Enzymes,,"The authors are thankful to the Management of PES University, Bengaluru, India for providing all the necessary facilities and support through a scholarship to one of the authors to conduct this research work.",,,,,,,,,,"Sutar, N.; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, India; email: nix1710@gmail.com

Since IoT nodes have a poor processors, it becomes necessary to identify an attack in a single IoT device or will become more challenging. This mechanism looks into the possibilities of vulnerability in a single IoT device by making use of machine learning algorithms. Initially, the IoT-23 dataset is passed to the preprocessing. After preprocessing and feature selection, it is trained and evaluated in multiple ML techniques such as random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models.

To achieve this task, the paper makes use of a labelled dataset consisting of around 3000 audio clips assigned to 8 different emotions. We experiment with a variety of hand-crafted features extracted from the audio signal to train 7 machine learning models and a multi-layer perceptron model and obtain the optimal feature set. It was observed that merely audio features extracted from utterances could classify emotions with an accuracy of 85% which is very promising since considering additional details, particularly facial expressions would prove to be very computationally intensive. Furthermore, this language-agnostic model is immensely useful as it works with numerous languages and dialects without requiring language-specific information.

The messages and themes in movies have the power to shape social attitudes and potentially bring about change. However, it is important to consider the potential negative effects that certain scenes and dialogues can have on vulnerable members of society, such as children. They can be considered a reflection of society’s current attitudes. The Motion Picture Association film rating system (MPAA) has been utilized since 1945 to classify movies and TV series based on factors such as violence, language, and sexual content. This research aims to use data analysis and machine learning to predict the MPAA rating of a movie based on its script by splitting the script into categories such as “angry,” “sad,” “happy,” “surprised,” and “fear” and examining the impact of each on the rating. An ensemble method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the prediction.

This pressure difference gives rise to wing-tip vortices, which leads to the generation of lift-induced drag. Induced drag is a major contributor to the overall drag on the wing. Winglets are a type of wing-tip devices whose main purpose is to reduce the lift-induced drag on a wing by reducing the strength of the wing-tip vortices. This provides an increase in the performance and efficiency of the aircraft and a reduction in the energy consumed. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of sweep angle variations on winglet performance, to improve the lift-to-drag ratio of the wing and therefore enhance the performance of the wing. During the course of this study parametric CFD analysis is conducted by varying the sweep angle and fixing the other winglet design parameters like the cant angle, blend radius, taper ratio and winglet span.

Consequently, this study focuses on investigating thermophoresis, Brownian motion, a non-uniform heat source/sink and suction influence on Maxwell, Jeffrey and Oldroyd-B nanofluids towards a stretching cylindrical annular surface with an induced magnetic field (IMF). The non-linear ODEs are solved numerically by opting for GFEM for the transformed system. The obtained GFEM results are compared and are in exceptional agreement with existing results, in the limiting sense. The boundary layer of the velocity and IMF are reduced by the Lorentz force, and also in the vertical annulus the IMF is independent of magnetic parameter (Formula presented.) and is reliant on the size of the radius ratio. For higher values of Nb (Formula presented.) the temperature distribution in the annulus accelerates, whereas the concentration profile decelerates. Additionally, heat and mass transfer characteristics are analysed in the annulus through ANN–BLMN. The important outcome of this study is that the Jeffrey model outperforms the Maxwell and Oldroyd-B nanofluid models in terms of heat and mass transfer rates. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ANN–BLMN; FEM; IMF; Jeffrey nanofluid; Maxwell nanofluid; Oldroyd-B nanofluid,Boundary layers; Brownian movement; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Magnetic fields; Mass transfer; Nanofluidics; ANN–BLMN; Induced magnetic fields; Jeffrey nanofluid; Jeffreys; Maxwell nanofluid; Nanofluids; Oldroyd-B; Oldroyd-B nanofluid; Finite element method,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leela, V.; Department of Science and Humanities, Karnataka, India; email: leelav@pes.edu",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1430750,,IJAED,,English,Int J Ambient Energy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152389456,,,,,,,

It might be difficult to both see and feel what is going on around you if you have vision impairment of any kind. It's challenging to move around and carry out tasks on one's own. Studies estimate that there were more than 285 million visually impaired people in the world in 2012. The majority of the things in and around us share the same shape and size, which makes it much harder for someone who is visually impaired to grasp his surroundings. More than twice as many visually impaired people as the general population suffer from clinical depression. Understanding user accessibility and the kind of output that would work best in this situation proved to be a challenge. The delay has to be taken into consideration because the output had to be in real-time. The user may not benefit much from straightforward object recognition. So, using object recognition, the features have been investigated. A number of changes to different YOLO versions were made in order to develop object recognition. To recognize objects, this paper suggests YOLO V5. Giving a description of the video being fed into the model is the second feature. For this encoder-decoder sequence has been put into use. The Model has been trained and examined using a variety of data sets, all of which have been further described. The next crucial element is distance estimation, which detects things in front of the user and alerts them if they are approaching too closely. In answer to all these demands, the proposed model with three attributes can benefit the blind and be supplied as a solution. The model processes the video or photo input to identify the things seen in it. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and VGG (Visual Geometry Group)16 are used to characterize the video. Triangular similarity and frozen graphs are used to measure distance and inform users if a subject is approaching the camera too closely. The user is provided with an audio description of the video being used as input. Both tools deliver audio as their output. © 2023 IEEE.",Distance estimation; Object detection; Video description; Visually impaired,Long short-term memory; Object detection; Clinical depression; Distance estimation; General population; Objects detection; Objects recognition; Shape and size; Video description; Vision impairments; Visually impaired; Visually impaired people; Object recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alva, A.S.; Pes University, India; email: spoorthyalva2k@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Proc.

Eating healthy becomes the next important concern, so going to a fast-food joint and preparing instant food may solve the problems related to food at the moment, but eventually it deteriorates health, either through weight fluctuation, energy loss, or both. To help overcome this, our proposed model aims to create a recipe recommendation system based on ingredient recognition. It helps explore new recipes in the kitchen for beginners, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike. Our system helps users decide what they can cook with the available resources by making use of images of ingredients. YOLOv5 has been employed to detect ingredients. This enables multiple object detection in real-time. An API call is done to calculate the calorie based on the amount of each ingredient. Recipe retrieval is done considering the ingredients detected, calorie count, various cuisines, and diet types. Users now have an idea of what they can cook, according to the recipes retrieved along with the nutritional value of each recipe. Based on the chosen recipe, similar recipes will be recommended by content-based recommendation system using K-Means Clustering. It helps improve user experience by saving time and energy in finding recipes for daily routines. By retrieving the appropriate recipes based on the items that are accessible and providing precise recipe suggestions, this system simplifies people's life. © 2023 IEEE.",Computer Vision; K-means clustering; Object Labeling; Recommendation,Energy dissipation; K-means clustering; Nutrition; Object detection; Recommender systems; API calls; Clustering approach; Fast food; Fluctuation energies; K-means++ clustering; Multiple-object detections; Object detectors; Object labeling; Real- time; Recommendation; Computer vision,,,,,,,,,,,,"Swain, M.; Pes University, India; email: Manasiswain2013@gmail.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Proc.

In recent years, there have been attempts to introduce blockchain-based identity management solutions, which allow the user to take over control of his/her own identity (i.e. self-sovereign identity). In this paper, we provide a short review of existing blockchain-based identity management methods. Based on the existing methods, we identify potential gaps and opportunities, and proposed an idea to overcome them using mutable blockchain concept[7] [10]. We have used two algorithms-creation of new identity and updation of existing identities on the blockchain. The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is to store the personal data securely in local database and the address of the corresponding data is stored in the blockchain in hashed format. The results for the proposed approach demonstrate that the mining difficulty and mining time varies with the number of transaction in per block. © 2023 IEEE.",Chameleon hashing; Consensus; Identity Management; Mutable Blockchain; Tokens,Block-chain; Chameleon hashing; Consensus; Digital identity; Digital operation; Identity management; Management method; Mutable blockchain; Real-world; Token; Blockchain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Int.

The proposed DNN model primarily consists of a long short-term memory architecture, with one network that decodes the common streams and another that decodes the private streams, in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) setting. The DNN-based detector is designed to decode RSMA messages from the superimposed signal at the base station (BS) in one go, and overcomes the disadvantages of a successive interference cancellation-based receiver. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed detector nearly attains the performance of the optimal maximum likelihood detector for various modulation schemes on common and private streams with OFDM. Further, we study the effect of number of transmit antennas and the DNN hyperparameters on the performance of the proposed detector, in terms of the symbol error rate. © 2023 IEEE.",Deep learning (DL); long short-term memory (LSTM); non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA); rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA); two-tier neural network,Antennas; Brain; Decoding; Intelligent systems; Long short-term memory; Maximum likelihood; Memory architecture; Monte Carlo methods; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Signal receivers; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Multiple access; Neural-networks; Non-orthogonal; Non-orthogonal multiple access; Rate splitting; Rate-splitting multiple access; Two tiers; Two-tier neural network; Deep neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spoorthy, K.R.; Pes University, India; email: spoorthykr@pesu.pes.edu",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.78167E+12,,,English,"Natl.

Most of the illnesses in the group are obstructive and may result in a loss of life. Heart and lung conditions make up a large portion of the obstructive illnesses in this group. More than 5 lakh people die each year from lung illnesses, generally known as pulmonary disorders, with an equal proportion of men and women affected. Each disease has unique symptoms that are connected to it in the fields of medicine and healthcare. There are several new tests that are being developed to identify each of the dangerous diseases that are on the rise. This results from the necessity for quick illness prediction.

The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the prevalent modes of education and pushed remote learning to the forefront. While remote learning has its advantages, there are also downsides, such as lack of learner engagement, learning fatigue, etc., resulting in less than satisfying learning outcomes. The pandemic also showed that simply moving existing teaching artifacts and methods to the virtual realm is not entirely adequate, especially for topics requiring experiential learning such as innovation and entrepreneurship. This project attempts to address some of these critical challenges by building a smartphone application platform for remote learning, emphasizing personalized and gamified learning. The project team adopted a creative approach to realize this ambitious project during the challenging pandemic by engaging current university students in all the implementation teams, eliminating the need to obtain external resources and funding. The student teams were motivated as the project was integrated with their regular university coursework. The gamified smartphone application with Design Thinking as the first learning module was developed and tested for functionality and usability.

They use lightweight virtualization that wraps an application with all its dependencies, binaries and libraries. They are also isolated, and therefore, useful in systems that host multiple applications. The security of these containers is an important, yet widely overlooked, aspect of container deployment and maintenance. Since the use of containers is extensive and only growing, a weak security framework can lead to vulnerable containers and in some cases, vulnerable hosts as well. Though guidelines such as the CIS benchmark exist, they are too broad as they harden the entire container without accounting for the compatibility of the security measures with the functionality of the application. It is often observed that on hardening the container, the functionality is hindered and the container, though now secure, is unable to perform the task it was created for. Thus, selecting which parts of the benchmark to apply and which to skip is a crucial part of developing a hardening policy. This paper deals with hardening containers, specifically those provided by a company that we shall not name. This is done by analyzing the image statically (before it is deployed) and then dynamically (while it is running).

It is also the domain which is least explored in the field of Machine Learning. The main reason for this is to build efficient artificial intelligence (AI) based models for preliminary diagnosis of various diseases, it would require a large corpus of data which can be obtained by pooling in patient information from multiple sources. However, for these sources to agree to sharing their data across distributed systems for training algorithms and models, there has to be an assurance that there will be no disclosure of the personally identifiable information (PII) of the respective Data Owners. This paper proposes PriMed, an approach to build robust privacy preserving additions to convolutional neural networks (CNN) for training and performing inference on medical images without compromising privacy. Since privacy of the data is preserved, large amounts of data can be effectively accumulated to increase the accuracy and efficiency of AI models in the field of healthcare. This involves implementing a hybrid of privacy-enhancing techniques like Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Homomorphic Encryption to provide a private and secure environment for learning through data. © 2023 The Authors.

This study is focused to formulate a pulsatile and mucoadhesive drug delivery system of an ACE inhibitor Perindopril Erbumine. Method: Two matrix tablets were punched with Eudragit RSPO, Eudragit RLPO, and HPMC K15M using a 3-3-3 Box-Behnken Design of Response Surface Methodology. Based on the design-optimized formulation P1T3 and P2T8 were coated for a lag time with compression coating of HPMC K4M and a blend of 1:1 ratio of ethylcellulose and carbopol polymer and further encapsulated in a Eudracap™ capsule to provide gastric resistance. Result: The in-vitro release data confirmed an initial pause phase of 4.5 h then release of the drug for 5.2 ± 0.3 h to cope with the early morning rush in blood pressure. After that, a gap of 6 h and then sustained release of the drug for 10.5 ± 0.5 h. From the ex-vivo study, mucoadhesive strength was obtained as 55.13 ± 0.03 gm and 56.39 ± 0.02 gm for P1T3 and P2T8 respectively. The lag time for coated tablet P1T3 came to 2.15 ± 0.15 h and for P2T8 11.9 ± 0.10 h proving the coating efficiency of polymers. Conclusion: The current study strongly suggests that perindopril Erbumine in association with Eudragit and Hypromellose polymer can open a path for the time-regulated release of the drug for hypertension chronotherapy with less risk of dose dumping. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Box-Behnken design (BBD); Eudragit RLPO; Eudragit RSPO; Ex-vivo; Perindopril erbumine,carbomer; colloidal silica; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; ethyl cellulose; eudragit; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; perindopril tert butylamine; polymer; polymethacrylic acid; quaternary ammonium derivative; stearic acid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; perindopril; polymethacrylic acid; angle of repose; animal experiment; Article; Box Behnken design; bulk density; chemical structure; controlled drug release; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; drug delivery system; ex vivo study; experimental design; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; in vitro study; intestine mucosa; mucoadhesion; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; response surface method; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; sustained drug release; tapped density; X ray diffraction; delayed release formulation; human; hypertension; tablet manufacture; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Delayed-Action Preparations; Humans; Hypertension; Hypromellose Derivatives; Perindopril; Polymers; Tablets,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, GPL","No grants from funding organizations in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors have been given to this work.

This tire is resistant to punctures and immune to blowouts. The present work aims to improve the aerodynamic design of the NPT by keeping the structure of the spokes hexagonal but varying other design features like tread pattern and adding material and filets. CAD designs were developed using Fusion 360 software and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is carried out using SimScale software. The variation of camber and yaw angles has been conducted with both tread and material enhancement. There was a decrease in drag and lift when the material was added to all the tires, but for all variations of yaw and camber, an increase in drag and lift was seen. The analysis is further extended to see the effect of a wheel well on the aerodynamic performance of the NPT. A decrease in drag and lift of nearly 33.2% and 94.5%, respectively, were observed with a wheel well. © 2023 SAE International.

Our work focuses on two of the most pressing issues—attendance and unsolicited energy consumption. Our goal was to overhaul the manual system, without compromising its integrity. We have developed a portable RFID fingerprint scanner that uses capacitance to gauge the depth of the finger and collect the fingerprint that must be activated by the professor, thereby making our system fail proof. The data generated is stored in a cloud server and is used to draw behavioral patterns. We are accustomed to leaving our fans and lights unattended, which poses a serious environmental threat. Our solution is to build a smart eco-system to detect the presence of a person and automatically switch on the necessary appliances. Further, this in combination with various algorithms can be used to adjust the speed of fans and brightness of lights based on external factors. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Automatic attendance; Energy optimization; Fingerprint scanner; Internet of things; Smart classroom systems; Smart university; Windows application,Energy utilization; Automatic attendance; Classroom environment; College campus; Energy optimization; Fingerprint scanners; Learning experiences; Smart classroom; Smart classroom system; Smart universities; Windows application; Internet of things,,,,,,,,,,,,"Annapurna, D.; PES UniversityIndia; email: annapurnad@pes.edu",Kumar A.Senatore S.Gunjan V.K.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18761100,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

They play an essential role in helping people relive events from the past, making them appreciate and view different scenarios from various perspectives. These frozen moments, however, can be lost with time due to natural or man-made causes. The work proposed shows how using a sequential pipeline involving independent, denoising and deblurring models paired with spatial filters can facilitate restoring the appearance of photos. The system takes in a digital copy of the image that requires restoration, which after passing through spatial filtering is fed to the denoising and deblurring models built using different convolutional auto-encoder architectures. The pipeline proposed consisting of independent models provides the additional benefits of using only the particular component needed for recovery of an image while also supporting the change of an individual model architecture without influencing the other components involved. This paper, thus presents a novel approach for restoring the condition of photos that have lost their quality due to the addition of noise and blur. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Convolutional auto-encoders; Deblurring; Denoising; Resnet optimized auto-encoder; Spatial filtering,Beamforming; Convolution; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Restoration; Signal encoding; Auto encoders; Convolutional auto-encoder; De-noising; Deblurring; Digital copy; Encoder architecture; Resnet optimized auto-encoder; Spatial filterings; Spatial filters; Pipelines,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhat, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Karnataka, India; email: abhijnya.bhat@gmail.com",Saraswat M.Chowdhury C.Kumar Mandal C.Gandomi A.H.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

Along with development, different kinds of networks such as LAN, WLAN, and WAN came into picture. Wireless local area network (WLAN) is the most used communication network in relatively smaller areas such as houses, schools, and offices. WLAN follows security such as WEP and encryption, but there are still vulnerabilities in the lower layer of the protocol stack. The vulnerabilities in the IEEE 802.11 have proved to be a medium for denial-of-service attack. Due to susceptibility of management frames, WLAN is vulnerable to medium access control-based (MAC) denial-of-service attacks. The results of these DOS attacks can range from man-in-the-middle attack to network congestion. By spoofing the MAC address of any legitimate user, deauthentication can be rendered to break the connection between the user and the Internet access point. There have been various amendments in the protocols to avoid the attacks on the MAC layer. But, much success hasn’t been registered till date. Various algorithms such as medium access control spoof detection and prevention (MAC SDP DoS) perform spoof detection and prevention to render MAC layer attacks affectless. This paper talks about the technique for rendering the DoS deauthentication attack and also present the analysis of the packet that is sent to attack on MAC layer. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Deauthentication; Denial-of-service; IEEE 802.11; MAC; Spoofing,Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; IEEE Standards; Internet of things; Network security; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Communications networks; Deauthentication; Denial of Service; Denialof- service attacks; IEEE 802.11; Medium access control-based; Protocol stack; Small area; Spoof detection; Spoofing; Medium access control,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aggrawal, A.; Department of Computer Science, Electronic City, Karnataka, India; email: abhayagarwal383@gmail.com",Gunjan V.K.Zurada J.M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

This ensures that CIA triad has not been violated and would help in achieving more security and a faster data transmission. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Ad-hoc networks; LAR; RSA,Data communication systems; Routing protocols; Ad-hoc networks; Location aided; Location aided routing; On-line communication; Private data; Real-time environment; Routing system; RSA; RSA cryptographic algorithm; Secure routing; Ad hoc networks,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vamshi Krishna Reddy, K.; Department of Computer Science, Electronic City, Karnataka, India; email: vamshik778@gmail.com",Gunjan V.K.Zurada J.M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

The proposed multibit EDAC is verified in two different steps. First, the encoder and decoder units are verified using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). It is noted that all burst errors up to 4 bits are detected and corrected with 100% accuracy. The code coverage is measured up to 95% minimum. Following that, the same EDAC unit is verified by incorporating it into advanced microcontroller bus architecture. The results show that the EDAC unit has passed all memory testing successfully.

In the annular porous region the inner cylinder is considered as electrically conducting and the outer cylinder as electrically non-conducting. The heat transfer is expected due to mixed convection and non-linear thermal radiation. The Galerkin finite element method is adopted to solve the governing equations. In the vertical annulus an increase in the magnetic Prandtl and Hartmann number reduces the velocity and induced magnetic field due to a strong external magnetic field and the Lorentz force. The higher Brinkmann values decelerate the conduction of heat generated by viscous dissipation hence, the temperature increases. The fluid and solid temperature increase with the buoyancy parameter. The non-linear radiation term enhances the fluid temperature, whereas it decelerates the solid temperature. The ANN model utilises finite element method output for training, validating and testing to predict the heat transfer characteristics.

It is often caused by the dispersion of light into the moisture particles present, smoke etc. This results in lower performance in high level vision tasks such as object detection, free space detection, scene understanding, etc. Hence the images have to be de-hazed before applying other high level algorithms. Dehazing is the process of reconstructing the original colour and contrast of the image if taken in normal conditions. Image dehazing is a non-trivial task as it is hard to collect haze free ground truth images. Further, achieving dehazed images when variable haze is present is a significantly harder challenge. In this research, we propose the Non Homogeneous RESIDE dataset (NH-RESIDE) that contains images created synthetically using the principles of randomness and representativeness. Experimental results show that the model trained on our dataset produces visually more pleasing images with a much better dehazing effect on real world images. The model implemented in this paper also outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a huge margin on the NH-Haze dataset proposed by the NTIRE Non Homogeneous Dehazing Challenge at CVPR, achieving an average PSNR of 25.69 and an average SSIM of 0.80. It also achieves much better processing times when compared to other models, thereby facilitating real-time performance. © 2023 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Demulsification; Object detection; %moisture; Atmospheric effects; Dehazing; Free spaces; High-level visions; Non-homogeneous; Objects detection; Performance; Single image dehazing; Space detection; Smoke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9.79835E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE/CVF Winter Conf.

It requires joint modeling of the language space and the image space. This task is less studied due to numerous problems, some of which are - high diversity and abstractness in descriptions of human facial features, lack of datasets, and difficulty in independent manipulation of discrete facial features in the image space to produce the desired, high quality human face images. In our work, we attempt to resolve some of the aforementioned challenges that exist in the context of the task. This paper presents the Text-to-Face Search and Transform model, TTF-ST for short, which introduces a novel technique of searching and selecting images from a custom dataset that best match the encoded textual description and subsequently transforming their latent vectors to enhance the accuracy of the generated images. The methodology proposed in this paper also allows for the usage of complex and diversified textual descriptions, while generating images of high resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. A new metric is introduced to allow for a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance by accounting for only those facial attributes specified in the description. Extensive experiments and comparisons with the current models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in accuracy while generating diverse high-quality photo-realistic images. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Diversity; Face description; Face image generation; High resolution; Multi-label; Text-to-face synthesis,Image enhancement; Diversity; Face descriptions; Face image generation; Face images; Face synthesis; High resolution; Image generations; Multi-labels; Text-to-face synthesis; Textual description; Modeling languages,,,,,,,,,,,,"Temkar, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: srinidhiptemkar@pesu.pes.edu",Yan W.Q.Nguyen M.Stommel M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,3029743,9.78303E+12,,,English,Lect.

Although, in the last few decades, mental illness rates create more attention, and also, many cases are not recognized as now. Indications related to the mental illness are visible on web forums, Facebook and Twitter; henceforth, computerized techniques are in demand in earlier detection of mental illnesses and depression. In this case, automated analysis of mental illness detection on social media may provide early accurate detection process. Studies have so far explored how the use of social networking sites is linked to mental illness in users or attempts to diagnose mental illness by analysing user-generated content.

The current method of generating disparity maps involves offline computation as the rover has low computational power. This work proposes a novel method to estimate a good quality disparity map for regions where the surface is similar to that of the moon. The surface of the moon is covered by craters distributed unevenly throughout. Regions with little to no texture pose a major challenge in stereo matching. In the proposed method the processing pipeline involves image rectification using camera calibration, disparity map generation, disparity map refinement. The proposed method generates accurate disparity maps from the Lunar Navigation Camera(Navcam) images under lunar-like illumination conditions. In this method, occlusion handling is also proposed to improve the quality of generated disparity maps. The proposed method outperforms other previously established methods with the experimental data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Disparity map; Images; Lunar rover; Moon; Stereo cameras,Moon; Motion planning; Navigation; Rovers; Stereo image processing; Textures; Visual servoing; 'current; Celestial bodies; Dense disparity maps; Disparity map; Image; Lunar rovers; Map generation; Navigation cameras; Off-line computation; Stereo cameras; Cameras,"Indian Space Research Organisation, इसरो",The authors would like to thank ISRO for helping and supporting the project.,,,,,,,,,,"Tripathi, S.; PES University, Karnataka, India; email: shikha.eee@gmail.com",Doriya R.Soni B.Shukla A.Gao X.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18761100,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

The proposed DL detector completely eliminates the need for the use of successive interference cancellation (SIC), which suffers from disadvantages such as error propagation. In an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing setting, we show that the proposed DL detector outperforms the standard SIC receivers such as the least squares detector and the minimum mean-squared error receiver, and attains the performance of the optimal maximum likelihood detector, in terms of the symbol error rate (SER).

The network consists of a source (S) modem, two relay (R) modems and a destination (D) modem. In each of the two time slots, S communicates with one R using NOMA, and the other R communicates with D using the decode-and-forward technique. We consider both scenarios where a direct link may or may not exist between S and D. We derive expressions for the approximate average sum rate and overall outage probability of the network. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal power allocation coefficients at S, such that the sum rate is maximized. We establish the accuracy of our approximations using Monte Carlo simulations.

The vertical boundaries are considered to be rigid and maintained at different uniform temperatures. The similarities and differences between the linear and quadratic density-temperature relationships on the base flow, stability features of fluid flow, and the mode of instability are underlined. If the flow is governed by classical Darcy's law, then it is proved analytically that the base flow remains unconditionally stable irrespective of how the density varies with temperature. On the contrary, the change in the density-temperature relationship affects the stability of base flow when the flow is governed by either unsteady Darcy's law or the Brinkman-extended Darcy law and for these cases, the eigenvalue problem is solved numerically. For the unsteady Darcy flow model, instability occurs through the traveling-wave mode in a certain range of Darcy-Prandtl number for the quadratic density law yet the base flow is always stable if the density law is linear. The nature of the density-temperature relationship and the magnitude of governing parameters combine together in influencing the instability of fluid flow in the Brinkman regime. The possibility of otherwise stabilization of the base flow becoming unstable with the change in the density-temperature relationship from linear to quadratic for the same values of governing parameters is identified. These intricacies are discussed in detail by computing the critical stability parameters for different values of the Darcy-Prandtl number and the Darcy number. © 2023 Author(s).",,Aerodynamics; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Parallel flow; Porous materials; Prandtl number; Baseflows; Brinkman porous medias; Buoyant flow; Darcy law; Darcy-Prandtl number; Density maximum; Governing parameters; Maximum density; Vertical boundaries; Vertical channels; Stability,,"We are indebted to two anonymous referees for their careful reading of the manuscript and constructive suggestions.

Extracting summary manually is a very redundant and time-consuming process. A good summarizing technique is one where we discern all the important points and topics of a speech or document without leaving out any valuable information. Summarizing a speech without losing the actual context has always been a challenge for programmers for a long time. This paper explores a method to divide a large speech into multiple small speeches to summarize them individually to generate an efficient and precise summary. Each sub-speech is further processed to predict the emotion of the speaker at various points during the speech. These individual emotions are used to classify a generalized emotion of the speaker throughout the speech. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Automatic speech recognition; Emotion recognition; Sentence similarity; Speech summarization; Speech-to-text; Textual data,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Choudhary, H.; PES University, Karnataka, India; email: choudhary.harsh6@gmail.com",,Springer,21953988,,,,English,Cogn.

Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) possesses technological, environmental, and economic benefits over Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine. Thus, the present work investigates on the design and analysis of two airfoil profiles (NACA 0012 & NACA 0018) with VAWT using ANSYS Fluent 2020 R2 solver. The structural stability (deformation) of Aluminum blades at varied wind speeds throughout the energy conversion is the prime focus of the present work. Developed airfoil models showed the structural stability even at extreme pressure, with minimal deformation, stress and strain. The velocity and pressure contours at diverse wind speeds (3, 5 and 10 m/s) are analyzed. It is evident that, the turbine blade were with uniform rotation even under turbulent flow. The outcomes of the analysis on the developed models showed good agreement to predict the torque and power.

The concept of raga and shruthi is fundamental in both Hindustani and Carnatic styles of music. Hence, when analyzing them, the identification of shruthi and raga is of prime importance. However, identifying the pitch, raga, and instrument from an Indian classical instrumental polyphonic audio for analysis proves to be quite a tough challenge. This chapter proposes a comprehensive comparison among convolution neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and XGboost. There are three distinguishing feature sets created for each task. The first feature set comprises 26 defining features extracted from the songs, while the second feature set consists of 10 of the most significant features among the 26 defining features, and the third feature set is made up of 26 features extracted from source-separated audio files. The three models were created for individual tasks, and their performance is evaluated for the three feature sets. The implemented CNN and XGboost models have had an accuracy of around 70% and 90%, respectively. The RNN model, on the other hand, showed approximately 98% percent accuracy due to its internal memory and unique features. The three individual tasks are combined to make a single model with RNN architecture. This combined model then demonstrated an approximate accuracy of 97.2% which is close to the accuracy obtained for the individual tasks. For the three tasks, CNN, RNN, and XGboost had favorable accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",CNN; MIR; Regression; RNN; Tonic identification; XGboost,Music; Source separation; Comprehensive comparisons; Convolution neural network; Features sets; Indian classical music; Joint identifications; Learning approach; MIR; Regression; Tonic identification; Xgboost; Recurrent neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhat, A.; Department of Electronics and Communication, Karnataka, India; email: ashwinib@pes.edu",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18604862,,,,English,Signals Commun.

Computers mathematically analyze hand movements, and this technology can be used to exchange data or interact with the environment containing humans and computers or between them. Gesture-based interactions are one of the most comfortable and straightforward ways to communicate with the environment. The efficiency of vision-based approaches or the operation of such devices is highly dependent on lighting conditions and camera-facing angles. Sensor-based approaches thought are void of environmental conditions. However, they face the portability problem—this study attempts to address this limitation by proposing a sensor-based input device, Arduino Nano 33 BLE. On the other hand, hand gestures have limits in conveying the complexity and diversity of human intentions. Each application program demands various user intentions; we created a hybrid input device to solve these constraints. The computer already recognizes the presently running application. When the currently running program changes, the same gesture provides a new function required by the new app. As a result, the number and complexity of basic hand movements can be significantly reduced. As we want our physical model to be a simple stick fitted with sensors, we employ Arduino Nano 33 BLE containing IMU, which has one miniature three-axis accelerometer and one miniature three-axis gyroscope, the data of which is rasterized and converted to a rasterized image. For continuous gesture identification, we employ a CNN machine learning model. Five-unit hand gestures in our system successfully provide most functionality given by numerous input devices. Our approach’s characteristics are automatically modified by recognizing application programs or understanding user preferences. The technique exhibits good accuracy (90–96%) in various application programs, promising for building a summary.

The main goal of cryptography is creating and analyzing methods to keep harmful third parties from gaining access to information transmitted between two entities. Cryptanalysis is the process of attempting to decipher ciphers, cipher text and cryptosystems in order to find any gaps or weaknesses in the systems that could lead to the discovery of the key used to encrypt the data. In this paper, we will investigate the purple cipher machine, a World War II era electromechanical cipher machine used by the Japanese diplomatic service for secure communication before and during WWII. It was considered as one of the hardest machines to crack during the time as a complete machine was never recovered. We present a brief overview of the machine’s internal construction and operation which is primarily controlled by 25-level stepping switches. The internal wiring of the machine displays intricate and complex wiring which made predictions hard. The Purple Machine, which has both encryption and decryption modules, was computer simulated using Python. Finally, for both modules, a time analysis for strings of various sizes is shown and the graph between them is drawn. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Cipher; Cryptography; Decryption; Encryption; Purple machine,Computer software; Military operations; Cipher; Ciphertexts; Decryption; Encryption and decryption; Gaining access; Large amounts of data; Purple machine; Third parties; Time analysis; World war II; Cryptography,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shabarinath, K.; Department of CSE, EC Campus, India; email: shabarinathkookal@gmail.com",Shetty N.R.Prasad N.H.Patnaik L.M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18761100,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

We have proposed a novel way of determining logical errors like infinite loops, segmentation faults, off-by-one errors and indicate where the programs have gone wrong along with indicating possible memory leaks. This approach could assist the students in learning from their mistakes and also provide insights to the teachers regarding the common logical errors that the students commit so that the teachers can address these issues in their lectures.

Stircasting technique is one of the most commonly accepted techniques. In this research work, Al6061 / TiB2 +CeO2 hybrid MMCs have been fabricated with varying wt. % of TiB2 (2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10%) particulates and constant 5% of CeO2 particulates. The monolithic alloy and hybrid composite were hot-rolled at a temperature of 515°C. Both the monolithic and hot-rolled hybrid composites were subjected to micro-structural study, hardness and tensile test. Optical microscope analysis revealed uniform dispersal of hard particles within the base matrix in case of both of ascast and hot-rolled composites. Both ascast and hotrolled hybrid composites showed extensive enhanced mechanical behavior and high wear resistance when compared with monolithic alloy. Hot rolled MMCs showed enhancement of 25 % of hardness when compared with monolithic alloy with increasing reinforcement of 2.5-10 wt. % of TiB2 content. Tensile strength increased by 53.54 % for hot rolled composites when compared to the as cast and other hybrid composites.

We propose a method to find violations of guidelines like length of identifiers, use of global variables and depth of control structures. We also intend to check if a particular programming approach has been used such as dynamic programming or recursion. This paper discusses a method through which the given code can be analyzed statically to detect for the violations of selected guidelines.

As waste heat retrieving techniques, the TEGs are most feasible. TEG is a tool that, through the Seebeck (thermoelectric) effect, converts thermal energy into electric energy. TEG has linear V–I characteristics. TEG is DC power source with high-current, low-voltage characteristics, and hence, it is desirable that topology for these attributes is developed. TEGs, in this case, is very expensive and less efficient. Therefore, to get step-up DC at the end of the converter linked to TEG, a high-gain DC/DC transfer network with high performance is used. A new topology for high step-up DC/DC conversion is presented in this article with a 4.5 V input supply and a converter output of 218.2 V.

Chromium is added to iron matrix in various proportions of 2%Cr, 4%Cr, 6%Cr, and 8%Cr and the remaining is Fe powder. First challenge was to produce these metal matrix composites by using the powder metallurgy technique, we also added zinc stearate as a binder and die releasing agent. The compaction load is optimized to 160KN by trial-and-error method to get a healthy specimen and the required density is achieved (Mahajan et al. in Indian J Sci Technol 8:101–105, 2015). These compacted green specimens were sintered at 12,000 C to make them hard and useable shape. Once this Fe–Cr metal matrix composite is successfully prepared by using the powder metallurgy technique these composites were tested for Vickers Hardness number and corrosion behaviour and tested under an optical microscope to study on microstructure of the prepared composites (Gurcan and Baker in Wear 188:185–191, 1995). During these tests, it showed that the purest iron specimen produced at 160 KN load and sintered at 12,000 C showed a hardness of 126HV against a 100HV of 6% of Cr in the Fe matrix, that clearly shows that Cr is not contributing much to the hardness of the composites (Yih and Chung in Int J Powder Metall (1986) 31(4):335–340, 1995). Corrosion tests on these sample show that adding Cr to Fe matrix will definitely delay the corrosion to a good extent and microstructure studies revealed that chromium reinforcement in the iron matrix is uniformly distributed and no internal defects are found (Saheb in ARPN J Eng Appl Sci 6:41–46, 2011). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Corrosion; Ferrous materials; Hardness; Metal matrix composites; Powder metallurgy,Corrosive effects; Iron; Metallic matrix composites; Microstructure; Powder metals; Sintering; Vickers hardness; Corrosion behaviour; Ferrous materials; Ferrous metals; Iron matrix; matrix; Matrix composite; Mechanical behavior; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; Powder metallurgy techniques; Powder metallurgy,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dileep, B.P.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: bp_dileep@blr.amrita.edu",Hegde S.Mishra A.Singh D.K.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,21954356,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

The refractive index and density values of the varied alkali glasses were determined, and the values were incorporated into the Judd–Ofelt (J.O) analysis. The excitation and emission spectral analysis of glasses helped to optimize the effect of Dy3+ ion concentrations on visible light emission properties of zinc barium lithium borate glasses. The FTIR analysis revealed the structural changes due to alkali ion variation in the glasses. The oscillator strength of identical absorption transitions corresponding to the absorption spectrum was calculated with the change in alkali group in the host glass. Especially, excitation spectra of the Dy3+ doped zinc barium borate glass revealed the spectral changes and its dependency on the alkali component in the host borate glasses.

In this paper, we formulate a dual strategy of semi-supervised deep neural co-training technique along with transfer learning based on in-domain pre-training to vastly improve model efficiency relative to its supervised counterpart for the task of review polarity prediction.

As companies become more distributed and autonomous, emerging applications demand more bandwidth, low latency, more spectrum, and higher reliability. 5G technology can aid many industries or enterprises to make quicker and better business decisions. Private 5G networks, also called 5G Non-Public Networks (5G-NPN), is a 3GPP-based standalone 5G network positioned for a particular enterprise or use case that delivers dedicated network access. It sets to transform industry landscapes with networks capable of rapidly deploying modern use cases and the scalability to meet constantly increasing demands of data capacity and speed. They help generate more revenue for operators who can partner with enterprises to build and manage networks on-premise or in the cloud. The objective of this work is to offer a thorough summary of private 5G networks to assist academicians, researchers, and network developers to quickly grasp their functionalities without needing to go through the standards, specifications, or documentation. This paper discusses various key private 5G network design goals and requirements, examines its deployment scenarios, and explores spectrum considerations and security aspects. The paper presents several enterprise use cases to illuminate how the networks can deliver the demands and services expected by the industries. It also provides an overview of some of the open-source projects considered by various organizations for private network deployment.

As the complexity of data has increased due to higher dimensions, diverse approaches have been successfully tested for nearest neighbor queries, clustering algorithms, etc. These algorithms have been optimized and adapted for CPU, GPU and hybrid models as combination of CPU and GPU. Closest pair (CP) computation is a frequently used operation in range and distance-based queries. Although there are different algorithms and optimizations available for CP computations, suitability of GPU for this operation is yet to be explored. Hereby in this paper we propose CPU-GPU Hybrid Model, to optimize the closest pair (CP) of points problem concerning two-dimensional floating point values. As part of the combined model, the sorting phase is implemented on CPU and computation of closest pair is implemented on GPU. In this work, three CP algorithms are analyzed on CPU and CPU-GPU combinations. With the proposed algorithm on the CPU-GPU combined model, up to 12 times speedup is achieved in the closest pair computation time. Several parameters were tuned to work with the device-specific features and the overhead in terms of data transfer is also analyzed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Closest pair; CPU-GPU combined model; Divide and Conquer; Quick CP,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Auradkar, P.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Karnataka, India; email: prafullatak@pes.edu",Fong S.Dey N.Joshi A.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

Generalized analysis on serpentine channel cold plate for battery thermal management is very limited, especially using the finite element method (FEM). Through this study, we seek to obtain the maximum temperature on the cold plate subjected to uniform heat flux conditions from the Li-ion battery pack. The governing equations for the heat transfer through the cold plate under steady-state conditions are nondimensionalized to reduce the number of operating parameters from 12 to 4. The artificial neural network (ANN) is used to develop a correlation between nondimensionalized maximum temperature and the four nondimensional operating parameters. The ANN prediction has obtained a mean squared error (MSE) loss of the order of 10-6 and R2 value equal to 1 on the validation and test datasets. The temperature surface plots of the cold plate have been obtained for multiple channel configurations. The present study helps in reducing the overall computational time (59.13 s for 1296 simulations) and provides a generalized ANN-based correlation to predict the maximum temperature, which is vital to operate the battery under safe temperature limits. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Many hurdles popped up in due course of time, preventing the successful conduction of online examinations. Today, there is an application for each and everything and the number of users is steeply escalating. With such high rising demands and new necessities, it has become quite important to make sure the applications are easily available anytime and anywhere. Ensuring minimum downtime, frequent updates without any disruptions, and making it easily available for both developers and consumers are must-haves now. Satisfying these requirements over a monolithic architecture is not assured, hence, the microservices architecture is adopted, thus opening the door for new possibilities. This being the foundation of this project, an amalgam of how the web application we used is divided into microservices, containerization of each of them followed by pod deployment and finally using Kubernetes for service exposing and orchestration is presented in this paper.

Apart from safety, factors such as power consumption and operating cost are the most important constraints to be considered in designing an energy-efficient and cost-effective cooling solution. In this study, the experimental data available from previous research on the use of functionalized graphene-based nanofluids in compact heat exchangers such as the automotive radiator is used to optimize the heat transfer performance parameters like Nusselt number of the nanofluid, the friction factor, and effectiveness of the heat exchanger. A supervised machine learning technique like the artificial neural network is used to obtain the objective functions of the response variables in terms of input features such as Reynolds number, Prandtl number, the volume concentration of nanoparticles in the base fluid, number of transfer units, heat capacity, the density of nanofluid, pressure drop and velocity. On the current dataset, it is found that by using the Bayesian regularization training algorithm and tangent sigmoidal activation function in the neural network, the best accuracies in the prediction can be achieved. Well-known nature-inspired optimization algorithms like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing are used in optimizing the above-mentioned response variables. Both algorithms converged to the same values of the objective functions.

The heat transfer is presumed to be due to a combination of mixed convection and radiation. The stability of the flow is examined when the solid and fluid phases are not in local thermal equilibrium. The governing equations are solved numerically by both finite difference and finite element methods. To control the flow formation rate more accurately the induced magnetic field is also considered in this study. As the magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) and Hartmann number (M) get enhanced, the velocity and induced magnetic fields get retarded in the annulus due to the presence of drag-like force, namely, the Lorentz force. When there is an increase in the mixed convection parameter the induced magnetic field gets enhanced. An increase in radiation parameter tends to decline the fluid temperature and reverse the behavior of the solid temperature. Increment in Pm decreases the wall shear stress near the conducting cylinder. Increasing values of porous, magnetic, and radiation parameters lead to an unstable system with smaller heat transfer coefficient values but the system gets stabilized for larger values of heat transfer coefficient. The results could be used as first-hand information for comprehending and developing the thermal flow phenomenon in porous media. The obtained numerical results are in good accordance with the existing results.

There are many existing algorithms that schedule waiting processes, but each of those algorithms achieve good results in only one of the many useful features of a scheduler. Some important features of a scheduling algorithm are to reduce the waiting time, to give a fair share of CPU time to all the processes and to give preference to higher priority processes; Shortest Job First, Round Robin and Priority scheduling algorithms do them respectively. The proposed work combines all these desired properties into one algorithm, by making use of convolution neural network architecture. Using CNN architecture is advantageous because the data is controllable in the hidden layers. The data in the hidden layers could be both understood and manipulated; hence a more powerful neural network could be designed.

Dual-Path RNN model achieves better performance compared to previously reported systems like TasNet, Conv-TasNet, etc. even though the model size is about 20 times smaller. Adding video encoder into DPRNN architecture makes for a new efficient time domain multi-modal speech separator. The proposed architecture performs better than audio-only models in terms of Si-SNR.

With this, there has been a correlated rise in hate and inflammatory speeches against individuals and organisations—sometimes with severe consequences. Methods to classify ‘hate’ that is propagated through multi-modal media, such as memes (contains image and text), fail to capture the meaning by comprehending both the modes(i.e. image and text). While the text itself may not be hateful, images are utilised to lend additional context to the words to subtly imply and convey hatred. On the Facebook Hate Meme Dataset, specifically curated for conveying hate implicitly in memes (further complicated by the use of ‘benign confounders’), the baseline established by Facebook with a state-of-the-art visual-linguistic model such as VilBERT is 64.73%.

Exploration of this task so far does not account for fine-grained elements and spans shorter time periods, which is not sufficient to analyze a trend’s temporal behavior. In this work, we introduce a framework that can provide a probabilistic popularity score for the apparel in an image. It consists of a neural network that is trained to identify and extract all the fashion attributes from an image and a forecasting model trained over a dataset of attributes and their trendiness over the last century. When provided with an image, the framework extracts a list of all the fashion attributes. The forecasting model then predicts the future trend for each of the attributes in the list using the dataset. Finally, an average score for the dresses’ trendiness is generated. A number of models were tested for the forecasting task, and the best model was selected based on Mean Absolute Error. Models tried ranged from statistical time series forecasting models such as ARIMA and SARIMAX to neural network-based models such LSTMs and Seq2Seq models. The best model was found to be the Seq2Seq model, with an F1 score of 0.813, and hence, it was chosen for building the framework.

The design features suggested can be successfully implemented in components like aerofoils, engine carcass, blisks and disks. This is possible due to the advent of 3D printing technology.

This rapid change in the learning experience has brought with it the opportunity to explore new avenues such as online learning. In this paper, we outline a methodology that aims to aid this paradigm shift by proposing an automated question set generation model based on the video lectures delivered by the teacher. We study the usage of pre-trained Scientific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SCIBERT) checkpoints for question generation on text derived from video lectures. The proposed methodology takes into consideration the presence of multiple speakers in the video lectures and employs speaker diarization for obtaining the audio corresponding to the teacher’s voice. Diarization is implemented using the mean shift clustering algorithm. For the purpose of answer-agnostic question generation, pre-trained SCIBERT checkpoint is used to warm start an encoder–decoder model. The model is fine-tuned using the SQuAD dataset. The results show that the model is able to successfully generate questions for a given context derived from the transcript of a diarized video lecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",BERT; Mean shift algorithm; NLP; Question generation; SCIBERT; Speaker diarization,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nittala, S.; PES University EC CampusIndia; email: ndpsravanthi@gmail.com",Joshi A.Mahmud M.Ragel R.G.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,9.78981E+12,,,English,Lect.

Some of the advantages of moving towards zero energy buildings are decreased operation or maintenance costs, lower impact on the environment and more energy security, and a higher resilience in cases such as power outages and blackouts as well as natural disasters. The energy consumption of new buildings as well as pre-existing buildings can be decreased through retrofits for energy efficiency, energy conservation programs, reduction of plug loads, and integrated structural design. However, to proceed with retrofitting, there is a prerequisite of understanding the characteristics of the retrofits and careful planning as it is complex. Many methods of building retrofitting have been investigated previously to achieve near-zero energy or zero energy status. Therefore, the primary focus of this project lies in the review and proper assessment of available retrofitting technologies and how these can be applied to a pre-existing institutional structure in a university campus and their corresponding effect of the current energy consumption of the selected structure.

In most automotive sectors, drop weight analysis at varying velocity ranges is performed to evaluate the damage characteristics of the vehicle body. Hence, the present work leads us through the study on influence of low-velocity impact at varying heights over the Glass Laminate Aluminium-Reinforced Epoxy (GLARE) laminate characteristics. Here, the laminate of constant thickness was subjected to drop weight impact. Three distinct thicknesses of (0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mm) Al-2024 T3 aluminium alloy were used. The results indicate that laminate can sustain up to critical load in terms of impact velocity as 3.13 m/s, and beyond which, it leads to delamination damage at 3.49 m/s. The above results indicate that the maximum absorbed energy by the laminate before catastrophic failure (crack) was noticed to be 14.43 J in the case of sample B. Further, it is noticed that GLARE laminate with 0.3 mm face sheet thickness has best results with reference to both absorbed energy and damage when compared with other thicknesses. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",drop weight test; GLARE; low-velocity impact; SEM,,,"Since this is a non-funded work, there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.",,,,,,,,,,"Kumar M, H.; Department of Automobile Engineering, Mysore Road, Kengeri, Karnataka-State, India; email: harishkumarcae@gmail.com",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,2374068X,,,,English,Adv.

The question that many HR managers are asking is why workers quit the company. Hiring new staff, rather than maintaining existing personnel, will always take more time and money. The project’s objective is to anticipate employee attrition before he or she departs the organization. The problem is predicting whether or not an employee will leave based on specific indications. Instead of focusing on a single classifier technique, the proposed study would tackle the problem utilizing a stacked classifier algorithm. The ensemble model will compute the prediction of each classification, and a new model will be constructed based on the ensemble technique used for prediction. Accurate forecasting will aid businesses in taking the required actions to reduce attrition. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Base models; Employee attrition; Machine learning; Meta-model; Prediction model; Stacked ensemble,,,"We would like to express our thanks to Dr. Pooja Agarwal, Professor, PESIT, for sharing her pearls of knowledge with us during the study process.

Hash-based algorithms for triangle counting fail to take advantage of available vectorization in modern processors. Linear algebraic-based methods often involve sparse matrix multiplication which is inherently expensive. Nonlinear algebraic methods have a slow implementation and count each triangle multiple times which is then rescaled to obtain the exact triangle count. We propose a fast vector instruction implementation of a set operation-based triangle counting algorithm, which avoids matrix multiplication and finds the exact triangle count directly. Our implementation outperforms reference implementations proposed by the MIT graph challenge and miniTri when tried on about 40 graphs from the SNAP large network dataset, giving a speedup ranging from 41× to more than 1500×. A comparison against existing state-of-the-art techniques gave a speedup of 3× on average. We additionally show that this algorithm can easily be plugged into graph frameworks that either use or can be modified to use compressed sparse row like representation, to give faster compute times. We also propose an optimization to the k truss decomposition algorithm that can be used with the optimized triangle counting algorithm to give better performance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Exact triangle counting; Graphs; Set operations; SIMD; SNAP; Vector instructions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Patgiri R.Deka G.C.Biswas A.,Academic Press Inc.,652458,9.78032E+12,,,English,Adv.

The GLARE specimens were fabricated using hand layup with vacuum bag moulding process wherein the aluminium sheets and E-Glass fibre woven mats of fixed thickness are bonded together by application of epoxy resins. Three different thicknesses of aluminium alloy (0.2 mm, 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm) Al-2024 T3 are used for the purpose of the study. The aluminium sheets are stacked together by application of epoxy resin between the sheets and are cured under a compression moulding machine under constant pressure. The overall thickness of the specimen is maintained constant for 2 mm. The samples were subjected to a three-point bending and tensile test as per ASTM D790 and ASTM D3039 standards, respectively, to evaluate their mechanical properties. The results indicate that the tensile strength of the composites is maximum for the specimen with aluminium 2024 T3 face sheet with a minimum thickness of 0.2 mm; however, with the increase in the thickness, the tensile strength is found to be decreasing. © 2021 Engineers Australia.",flexural; GLARE laminates; mechanical properties; mechanical testing; SEM; tensile,Epoxy resins; Glare; Glass fibers; Laminates; Molding; Sheet molding compounds; Tensile strength; Aluminum laminates; Face sheets; Fiber reinforced aluminum; Flexural; Flexural characteristics; GLARE laminate; Glass fibre reinforced; Hand lay-up; Tensile; Tensile characteristics; Tensile testing,,,,,,,,,,,,"Harish Kumar, M.; Department of Mechanical and Automobile Engineering, India; email: harishkumarcae@gmail.com",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,14484846,,,,English,Aust.

Hence, the present work deals with secondary processing ability like hole drilling on hard to machine FRP laminate. The influence of drilling attributes on the delamination factor and surface roughness contours are studied for a high thickness hybrid (carbon/glass FRP) laminates. Here, the experimentation was performed utilising Taguchi’s L27 design of experiments array. Later, on post-drilling, the predominant and optimum variables were studied through taguchi and variance analysis to highlight their contribution on the response functions. Taguchi results indicate that the combination of the 90՞tungsten carbide tool, speed of 800 rpm, and rate of feed 50 mm/min gives the best performance concerning the delamination. Also, it was observed that the combination of the 118՞tungsten carbide tool, cutting speed of 900 rpm and the rate of feed 60 mm/min give the best performance concerning surface roughness. Whereas, as per ANOVA, the highest percentage contribution factor was concerned to a tool material followed by other factors and analysed data lie with the confidence level of 95%.
