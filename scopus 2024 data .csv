The RKF45 approach was used to solve the Buongiorno nonlinear governing model. The effect of different parameters on the flow, energy, concentration, and entropy generating fields have been graphically illustrated and explained. The hyperbolic tangent nanoliquid has a better velocity than the Williamson nanofluid. The Williamson nanofluid has higher thermal energy and concentration than the hyperbolic tangent nanoliquid in the microchannel. The Grashof number, both thermal and solutal, increases the fluid flow rate throughout the flow system. The energy of the nanoliquid is reduced by the temperature jump condition, while the energy field of the nanoliquid is enhanced by the improving thermal conductivity value. The nanoliquids concentration rises as the Schmitt number rises. The irreversibility rate of the channel system is maximized by the variable thermal conductivity parameter. © 2024, The Author(s).",,nanofluid; nanomaterial; article; controlled study; diffusion; entropy; flow rate; fluid flow; pharmaceutics; simulation; temperature; thermal conductivity; thermodynamics; velocity,,,,,"University of Hail, UOH: RG-23 082",This research has been funded by Scientific Research Deanship at University of Hail - Saudi Arabia through project number RG-23 082.,,"Alzahrani, H.A.H., Alsaiari, A., Madhukesh, J.K., Naveen Kumar, R., Prasanna, B.M., Effect of thermal radiation on heat transfer in plane wall jet flow of Casson nanofluid with suction subject to a slip boundary condition (2022) Waves Random Complex Media, pp. 1-18. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3sXpvVGktb0%3D; Alsulami, M.D., Naveen Kumar, R., Punith Gowda, R.J., Prasannakumara, B.C., Analysis of heat transfer using Local thermal non-equilibrium conditions for a non-Newtonian fluid flow containing Ti6Al4V and AA7075 nanoparticles in a porous media (2023) ZAMM J.

The basis of our exploration involves the application of graph neural network architectures and machine learning to resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data for the purpose of detecting schizophrenia. Our study uses single-site data to avoid the shortcomings in generalizability of neuroimaging data obtained from multiple sites. Results: The performance of our graph neural network models is on par with that of our machine learning models, each of which is trained using 69 graph-theoretical measures computed from functional correlations between various regions of interest (ROI) in a brain graph. Our deep graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) demonstrates a promising average accuracy score of 0.82 and a sensitivity score of 0.84. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the role of advanced graph theoretical methods and machine learning on fMRI data to detect schizophrenia by harnessing changes in brain functional connectivity. The results of this study demonstrate the capabilities of using both traditional ML techniques as well as graph neural network-based methods to detect schizophrenia using features extracted from fMRI data. The study also proposes two methods to obtain potential biomarkers for the disease, many of which are corroborated by research in this area and can further help in the understanding of schizophrenia as a mental disorder. © 2023, The Author(s).",Binarization;

This problem can be solved by incorporating distributed generation (DG) at the consumer side itself. In order to enhance service availability, power quality, reliability, and loss reduction, DG is positioned optimally at the consumer end within the system. The optimal DG location and size is to be calculated in such a way that the total loss in the system should be minimal and cost savings should be maximal. In this study, for the investigation of effects of DG on reliability of distribution system, a practical 11 KV feeder with 41-bus, was employed. The selected practical feeder is modelled using the power world simulator (PWS) software and reliability of the system is verified by calculating various reliability indices such as system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI), system average interruption duration index (SAIDI), customer average interruption duration index (CAIDI), average system utility index (ASUI) and average service availability index (ASAI). After applying proposed loss sensitivity factor (LSF) method, the active and reactive power loss reduction are 41.30 % and 38.64 % respectively, least bus voltage is enhanced to 0.9405 pu from 0.8978 pu and the reliability indices are also improved. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Technological advancements have been made in intelligent devices that can process and summarize legal documents. However, developing such data-driven systems requires a scarcity of high-quality corpora. Legal AI uses artificial intelligence technology, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), to help with legal duties. Legal professionals frequently consider how to solve problems using rule-and symbol-based methods, but NLP researchers are more interested in data-driven and embedding methods. So, in this paper, we present Indian Legal Corpus (ILC), a dataset for Indian legal document summarization. Our dataset differs from the existing summarization datasets in a way that our summaries are highly abstractive. This dataset offers new research opportunities for Legal documents with an abstractive approach. ILC is highly abstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic evaluation. We are releasing our dataset and models to encourage future research on Legal abstractive summarization. © Engineered Science Publisher LLC 2024.",Abstractive; Extractive; Legal document summarization; Summarization,,,,,,,,,"Ježek, K., Steinberger, Josef, Automatic Text Summarization (The State-of-the-Art 2007 and New Challenges) (2008) Proceedings of the Znalosti, pp. 1-12; Munot, N., Govilkar, S.

CMCH was synthesized from chitosan dissolved in 20%w/v sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with monochloroacetic at 40 ± 5 °C and characterized by proton NMR, FTIR and Degree of Substitution. The microbiotically activated compression coated tablets (MACC-TABs) were prepared by wet granulation and compression coated with Eudragit S100: HPMC K100M in different ratios for enteric protection and ileo-colon selectivity. Dissolution studies without enzymes and in the presence of enzymes such as pepsin at pH 1.2, diastase and pancreatin at pH 6.8, the F1C3 did not show significant changes. Addition of colonic enzymes at the tenth hour resulted in significant increase in release of budesonide. The % Cumulative Drug Release was 98.49 ± 1.42%, due to the enzymatic triggering (produced by the colonic microflora) leading to the lysis of glycosidic bonds. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the pores formed after dissolution was due to the water-soluble nature of CMCH to release budesonide. The evidence during in-vitro dissolution studies confirmed the pH sensitivity along with microbiotic activation of the MACC-TABs tablets to efficiently and reproducibly release budesonide in the ileo-colon site in the presence of the bacterial enzymes.

GitHub Issues is used as a primary vehicle for collaboration between developers and users - to report defects, track features and seek clarifications. Handling and processing a massive number of Git Issues reported by developers and users is a major challenge and it is also quite expensive. An issue-tracking system can be used to manage the complexity by manually or semi-automatically assigning labels. However, manual browsing of Git Issues is not feasible for a medium or large size open-source product. In this paper, we present an automatic organizing system for Git Issues, wherein we group the issues based on similarities and present them both to the users and developers in the context of issues that they are working on. This system will save a lot of time and cost (i) for users who are looking for quick fix or known solutions, and (ii) for developers who want to handle all related issues at once. Thereby, simplify the collaboration among the users and developers. © 2024 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Gousios, G., (2014) Proceedings of the 11th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories; Kallis, R., (2021) Science of Computer Programming, 205; Kallis, R., Di Sorbo, A., Canfora, G., Panichella, S., Predicting issue types on github (2021) Science of Computer Programming, 205; Dhasade, A., Balasaheb, A., Manasa, S., Venigalla, S., Chimalakonda, (2020), Proceedings of the 13th Innovations in Software Engineering Conference on Formerly known as India Software Engineering Conference; Izquierdo, J.L., Canovas, (2015) IEEE 22nd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER); Arya, D., (2019) 2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE); Li, Y., Chung, S.M., Holt, J.D., (2008) Data & Knowledge Engineering, 64, pp. 381-404; Jing, L., Ontology-based distance measure for text clustering (2006) Proc. of SIAM SDM Workshop on Text Mining","Gomez, S.; PES UniversityIndia; email: serenagomez1304@gmail.com",Raja S.K.S.Kiruthika S.U.Gervasi O.Jaichandran R.,,American Institute of Physics Inc.,"2022 International Virtual Conference on Machine Learning Applications in Applied Sciences and Mathematics, IVCMASM 2022",30 March 2022 through 31 March 2022,,196824,0094243X,9.78074E+12,,,English,AIP Conf.

However, their practical application is restricted due to their non-cost efficiency, low sensitivity, poor selectivity and high temperature sensing properties. Thus, the development of a sensor capable of overcoming the aforementioned limitations is critical for commercial deployment. As a result, a NiSe2-rGO composite-based H2 gas sensor has been prepared for the first time using a simple hydrothermal technique. The developed material has been systematically characterized for its morphological properties and thoroughly investigated for H2 gas sensing applications. The findings show that the developed NiSe2-rGO composite exhibited enhanced H2 gas sensing properties, besides possessing appreciable selectivity, repeatability as well as long-term stability. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a stable sensor response of 254% within 43 s and 13 s of response and recovery time respectively at a hydrogen concentration of 500 ppm which is 8 and 500 times higher than that of its individual counterparts (NiSe2 and rGO) over a wide relative humidity range, indicating the material's potential for application in industrial environments. Thus, this work paves the way for the development of stable, effective, fast-responding, and selective hydrogen gas sensors that are functional at room temperature. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",Environmental monitoring; H2 gas sensor; NiSe2-rGO composite; Repeatability and long-term stability; Room temperature,Chemical detection; Chemical sensors; Gas detectors; Gases; Hydrogen; Nickel compounds; Selenium compounds; Cost-efficiency; Environmental Monitoring; Gas-sensors; H2 gas sensor; High-temperature sensing; Hydrogen gas sensors; Long term stability; Low sensitivity; Nise2-rGO composite; Repeatability and long-term stability; Room temperature,,,,,"National Science and Technology Council, NSTC; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST: /CERI/MICALL19/2020/01, 110-2622-E-011-023","Chang-Mou Wu and his team are thankful to the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan, ROC, for the financial support for a part of this study under contract number; MOST 110-2622-E-011-023.

When there is a lot of movement, OTFS offers improved connectivity performance. While OFDM functions in the time-frequency domain, O-OTFS modulation acts in the delay-Doppler domain. This study provides an overview of how OTFS functions in the delay-Doppler domain, as well as its benefits and drawbacks.

It not only prevents further spread but also increases the revenue for the farmers. Leaf is a major part of any plant and its good health is very important for maximum yield. Maize is one of the major food crops in the world and contributes major part in food security. There are various reasons for leaf to get diseases that include pathogens like virus, bacteria, pests and even adverse environmental conditions. The idea of this paper is to take data set of maize leaf images with disease like blight, common rust and gray leaf spot along with healthy leaves, train it on different modified deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and use the trained models to test new leaf images. Deep convolutional neural networks have been modified as per the requirements by introducing new epochs, iterations, activation functions and learning rates. In the proposed work, ten different modified networks have been implemented starting from a simple AlexNet to a more complex network like EfficientNet-b0. In this experiment two different data set have been used, one from a standard data set from Kaggle and another is created manually by capturing images from our neighborhood farm lands at different stage of growth. Finally, a comparative study on different networks with two different data set is carried out. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Activation function; Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN); Epochs; Learning rate; Machine learning,Activation analysis; Chemical activation; Complex networks; Convolution; Crops; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Food supply; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Statistical tests; Viruses; Activation functions; Comparative analyzes; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Data set; Deep convolutional neural network; Epoch; Leaf images; Learning rates; Machine-learning; Convolutional neural networks,,,,,,,,"India Maize Summit (2014).

Roughly 51% of the world’s cases of blindness is a result of cataract even though it can be prevented if detected at an earlier stage. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving cataract detection model with a maximum accuracy of 98%, which predicts if a patient has cataract by processing their retinal scan using a decentralized framework called Swarm Learning. The main focus of this paper lies in preserving the privacy of patient data while creating an accurate and robust model. The performance of a machine learning model directly correlates with the amount of training data. Healthcare data is highly distributed in different hospitals, and data privacy laws make it difficult to collect data and train a model in a centralized setup. Hence this work focuses on a decentralized architecture, where each hospital acts as an individual node with its own training data and a VGG-19 cataract detection model. The model proposed in this paper provides promising results even though it contains non-independent and identically distributed data, i.e. the amount of data and the nature of data varies with each node. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Cataract detection; Decentralized architecture; Healthcare; Privacy-preserving machine learning; Swarm learning,Eye protection; Health care; Hospital data processing; Machine learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Swarm intelligence; Cataract detection; Decentralized architecture; Detection models; Empirical studies; Healthcare; Machine-learning; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving machine learning; Swarm learning; Training data; Hospitals,,,,,,"We sincerely thank and appreciate Mr. Ravi Sarveshwar, Master Technologist, ADC and Mr. Dharmendra, Section Manager, ADC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise for their constant support during the entire course of this work.

In comparison with the current top coat thickness, the current research presents a novel TBC that combines equal amounts of pure alumina (Al2O3) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with improved resistance to heat corrosion. Using the atmospheric plasma spray (APS) process, Al2O3 and YSZ were sprayed as a bond coat on cast iron substrates using the multilayer bond coat materials Metco 410NS and Metco 452. Utilizing a cyclic method, the hot corrosion behaviour of TBC was examined at 850 °C using a corrosive salt consisting of 45 weight percent sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and 55 weight percent vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) powders. In increments of 100 µm, the top coat thickness ranged from 100 to 300 µm. The results indicated that a 300 µm top coat thickness will result in a greater hot corrosion resistance.

Violinists use different types of bow strokes to express musical phrases, played by the movement of the right arm holding the fiddle bow. Although the sound produced by each bow stroke is distinct, it can be difficult for new fiddlers to distinguish and recognize these bowing techniques. So, this paper presents a novel approach of an ensemble of multimodal deep learning models consisting of one Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify into one of the five bowing classes: detaché, legato, martelé, spiccato and staccato. The dataset used consists of audio samples performed by 8 violinists along with the motion of their forearms measured using a Myo sensor device, to acquire 8-channels of Electromyogram (EMG) data and 13-channels of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. The audio features are extracted from audio excerpts and time domain features are extracted from EMG and IMU motion signals. These features are passed into an ensemble of deep learning models to make the final prediction using weighted voting. The proposed ensemble classifier was able to deliver optimal results with an overall accuracy of 99.5%, which is better than the previous studies that took only either audio or motion data into consideration. © 2024 by the authors.",audio features; Convolution Neural Network (CNN); deep learning model; Electromyogram (EMG); Essentia; Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU); Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); motion features; violin bowing technique,,,,,,,,,"Violin Masterclass: The Sassmannshaus tradition for violin playing, , http://www.violinmasterclass.com/, [Online].

To facilitate the assembly of these structures, fasteners are employed, and drilling is one of the secondary manufacturing processes that can produce cost-effective and good-quality holes for fastening. This paper deals with characterising the quality of the drilled holes in glass fibre-reinforced plastic-polyurethane foam sandwich structures. This experiment has been designed using Taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array. The results indicate that smaller drill diameter and lower feed rate produce delamination of lower magnitude at entry and exit while higher spindle speeds followed by lower feed rates produced holes with minimal deviation from the ideal form. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",delamination; Drilling; GFRP-PUF sandwich; Taguchi,,,,,,,,,"Geier, N., Jinyang, X., Pereszlaa, C., Drilling of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites: difficulties, challenges and expectations (2021) Procedia Manuf, 54, pp. 284-289; Tsao, C., Kuo, K., Hsu, I., Evaluation of a novel approach to a delamination factor after drilling composite laminates using a core–saw drill (2012) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 59 (5-8), pp. 617-622; Babu, N.S., Mathivanan, N., Kumar, K., Influence of machining parameters on the response variable during drilling of the hybrid laminate (2019) Aust J Mech Eng, 20 (1), pp. 1-10; Tsao, C.C., Hocheng, H., Taguchi analysis of delamination associated with various drill bits in drilling of composite material (2004) Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 44 (10), pp. 1085-1090; Tagliaferri, V., Caprino, G., Diterlizzi, A., Effect of drilling parameters on the finish and mechanical properties of GFRP composites (1990) Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 30 (1), pp. 77-84; Chen, W.-C., Some experimental investigations in the drilling of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite laminates (1997) Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 37 (8), pp. 1097-1108; Khashaba, U.A., (2004) Delamination in drilling GFR-thermoset composites, composite structures, 63 (3-4), pp. 313-327; Paulo Davim, J., Campos Rubio, J., Abrao, A.M., A novel approach based on digital image analysis to evaluate the delamination factor after drilling composite laminates (2007) Compos Sci Technol, 67 (9), pp. 1939-1945; Stone, R., Krishnamurthy, K., A neural network thrust force controller to minimize delamination during drilling of graphite-epoxy laminates (1996) Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 36 (9), pp. 985-1003; Arul, S., Vijayaraghavan, L., Malhotra, S.K., Influence of tool material on dynamics of drilling of GFRP composites (2006) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 29 (7-8), pp. 655-662; Latha, B., Senthilkumar, V.S., Palanikumar, K., Influence of drill geometry on thrust force in drilling GFRP composites (2011) J Reinf Plast Compos, 30 (6), pp. 463-472; Rajesh Mathivanan, N., Mahesh, B.S., Anup Shetty, H., An experimental investigation on the process parameters influencing machining forces during milling of carbon and glass fiber laminates (2016) Measurement, 91, pp. 39-45; Ghetia, D., Shandilya, A., Amogh Kumar, N.R., Experimental evaluation of factors influencing drilling of randomly oriented fibre reinforced composite laminates (2020) Aust J Mech Eng, 20 (5), pp. 1-16; Tyczynski, P., Lemanczyk, J., Robert Ostrowski, R.E.S., Drilling of CFRP, GFRP, glare type composites (2014) Aircraft Eng Aerospace Tech, 86 (4), pp. 312-322; Lazar, M.-B., Xirouchakis, P., Experimental analysis of drilling fiber reinforced composites (2011) Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 51 (12), pp. 937-946; Tamer Erturk, A., Vatansever, F., Yarar, E., Machining behavior of multiple layer polymer composite bearing with using different drill bits (2019) Composites, 176, p. 107318; Sharma, S.C., Krishna Munishamaiah, H.N.M., Narasimha Murthy, H.N., Delamination during drilling in polyurethane foam composite sandwich structures (2006) J Mater Eng Perform, 15 (3), pp. 306-310; Vinayagamoorthy, R., Latha, S., Saswath Kaundinya, G.T., A study on the properties of natural sandwich laminates Indian J Sci Technol, 9 (37), p. 2016; Devi, G.R., Palanikumar, K., Analysis on drilling of woven glass fibre reinforced aluminium sandwich laminates (2019) J Mater Res Technol, 8 (1), pp. 1024-1035; Rishikesan, V., Chaturvedi, B., Arunachalam, N., Characterisation of drilling-induced damage in GFRP honeycomb sandwich composites using acoustic emission (2021) Procedia Manuf, 53, pp. 664-672","Babu L, S.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, India; email: sbabu@cadprofessor.in",,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,,,2374068X,,,,English,Adv.

The parameters of the subsystems and the interconnection strengths between the subsystems are assumed unknown. Multiple adaptive prediction models with switching are used in this paper to address the relatively poor transient performance that typically results from a single prediction model. However, the application of this methodology requires indirect model reference discrete-time adaptive control, and there appears to be very little focus in the literature on this. The principal contribution of this paper is to fill this void by arriving at proof of global stability of such decentralised adaptive systems using the theory of Lyapunov and properties of square-summable sequences. The chosen representation of the system enables the same results to be directly applicable to both linear time-invariant and linear-in-the-parameters nonlinear subsystems. We consider two parametric update algorithms, one of which has a normalisation factor. Simulation studies included in this paper demonstrate the improvement in transient performance. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",adaptive control; decentralised control; discrete-time systems; Lyapunov methods; multiple models,Decentralized control; Digital control systems; Discrete time control systems; Invariance; Linear control systems; Lyapunov methods; Model reference adaptive control; Time varying control systems; Adaptive Control; Adaptive predictions; Decentralised control; Decentralized adaptive control; Discrete - time systems; Linear time-invariant system; Lyapunov's methods; Multiple-modeling; Prediction modelling; Transient performance; Linear time-invariant system,,,,,,,,"Narendra, K.S., Hierarchical adaptive control of rapidly time-varying systems using multiple models (2016) Control of Complex Systems: Theory and Applications Kidlington, pp. 33-66. , Vamvoudakis KG, Jagannathan S, eds., Elsevier; Vamvoudakis, K.G., Jagannathan, S., (2016) Control of Complex Systems: Theory and Applications, , eds., Elsevier; Başar, T., Uncertainty in complex networked systems (2018) Honor of Roberto Tempo, , ed., Birkhäuser (Springer Nature); Schäfer, B., Witthaut, D., Timme, M., Latora, V., Dynamically induced cascading failures in power system grids (2018) Nat Commun, 9, pp. 1-13; Sandell, N., Varaiya, P., Athans, M., Safonov, M., Survey of decentralized control methods for large scale systems (1978) IEEE Trans Automat Contr, 23 (2), pp. 108-128; Šiljak, D.D., (1991) Decentralized Control of Complex Systems, , Academic Press; Narendra, K.S., (2006) Decentralized Control and Decentralized Adaptive Control, , Tech.

Significant research has been done individually on colorizing and restoring degraded images. Separate studies of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have also been conducted in each of these fields. However, it’s rare to find GAN architectures that can focus on both the tasks at once. With an emphasis on nature photographs, this study proposes a unique GAN architecture that was trained on a customized image dataset including images of landscapes, flowers, and mountains combined with the GoPro Light dataset. The proposed methodology makes use of a combination of different loss functions that enable the model to focus on both tasks simultaneously. Alongside the L1 loss and adversarial loss traditionally used in GANs, the proposed model includes the perceptual loss that performs feature-wise comparisons between images to restore its inherent features. To prove that the GAN can perform both restoration and colorization, its performance has been compared with other models that perform each of the two tasks separately. The model is tested on the curated dataset and evaluated on image-specific metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity Index (SSIM). The model gives results that compare well with existing models, and it can colorize and restore images that have been degraded with motion blur or camera misfocus—successfully striking a good balance between the two tasks. The paper concludes by providing insight into the future work that can be carried out. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Colorization; Discriminator; GAN; Generator; Restoration,Discriminators; Generative adversarial networks; Image reconstruction; Network architecture; Signal to noise ratio; Colorization; Degraded images; Generator; High quality; Image datasets; Loss functions; Network-based; Peak signal to noise ratio; Performance; Structural similarity; Restoration,,,,,,,,"Arnaud R (2020) Landscape pictures, version 1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/landsc ape-pictures.

When a user wants a question to be answered they open their web browser and search for a query, many websites show up on the screen which the user can choose from. Dozens of Uniform Resource Locator (URLs) are created everyday, not all of them are safe and some are built for malicious purposes. The attacker who creates these malicious URLs can send multiple responses thereby disrupting the traffic and delaying the process. Our aim is to build and incorporate models which can classify that website and identify the category using URL and check for the presence of any application layer attacks. Our paper deals with capturing live network traffic and packets, extracting relevant values and feed these to URL and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) modules. We use certain heuristics, train and build the Machine Learning (ML) models like Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression giving accuracy of 87.51 and 95.89% respectively. Inspection of traffic from the website is analyzed by building a network traffic analyzer using pyshark to capture traffic in real time. For the detection method of IDS, we would be using Anomaly-Based methods and for identifying malicious traffic we would be using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify attacks into application layer attacks namely Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Cross-site Scripting (XSS), BruteForce, Denial of Service (DoS), Botnets, Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Anomaly based intrusion detection system; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Multinomial Naive Bayes; Support vector machine; URLs,Denial-of-service attack; Intrusion detection; Logistic regression; Network security; Query languages; Support vector machines; Anomaly based intrusion detection systems; Application layers; Intrusion Detection Systems; Live network traffic; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Multinomial naive bayes; Multiple response; Network packets; Support vectors machine; Websites,,,,,,,,"Joshi, M.R., (2016) A Review of Network Traffic Analysis and Prediction Techniques; Ahmed, A.A., Agunsoye, G., A Real-Time Network Traffic Classifier for Online Applications Using Machine Learning (2021) Algorithms, 14, p. 250; Manjeri, A.S., Kaushik, R., Ajay, M.N.V., Nair, P.C., A machine learning approach for detecting malicious websites using URL features (2019) 2019 3Rd International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA); Ding, C., (2020) Automatic Detection of Malicious Urls Using Fine-Tuned Classification Model; Junaid Khan, H.M., Niyaz, Q., Devabhaktuni, V.K., Guo, S., Shaikh, U., Identifying generic features for malicious URL detection system (2019) 2019 IEEE 10Th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON); https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaurov/website-classification-using-url; Ding, C., (2020) Automatic Detection of Malicious Urls Using Fine-Tuned Classification Model; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonyj453/urldataset","Uppara, V.; PES UNIVERSITY, India; email: uveereshadoni@gmail.com",Arai K.,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2023",7 September 2023 through 8 September 2023,,306609,23673370,9.78303E+12,,,English,Lect.

Born as a bare-bones structure in 1.0 it grew to incorporate some form of record preservation in 2.0 and then integrated communication between two entities in 3.0. Supply chain 4.0, the current one, has total global integration of multiple entities with the records digitised. But increasing entities and pipelines, means increasing complexities, overhead and soft spots. In this paper, a systematic literature review is done with the objective of analysing existing Supply Chain 4.0. The focus of the paper is the usage of blockchain technology in the electronic industry to provide a decentralised architecture. Several papers were compared on the basis of different schemas like the type of blockchain network used, platform deployed on, security of frameworks, representation of unique identity, testing authenticity, working implementation, cost of implementation, etc. The pros and cons of various privacy and security methodologies are also explored and discussed. The paper also discusses the open issues and challenges in the same area of interest. Finally, the paper outlines the future scope to be delved into as a part of the future research. © 2013 IEEE.",blockchain; electronic chips; security; smart contracts; Supply chain,Blockchain; Electronics industry; Supply chain management; 'current; Block-chain; Bone structure; Electronic chips; Electronic industries; Global integration; Security; Systematic literature review; Smart contract,,,,,,,,"Kirk, C.P., Rifkin, L.S., I'll trade you diamonds for toilet paper: Consumer reacting, coping and adapting behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) J.

The validity of the principle of exchange of stability is proved. The eigenvalue problems resulting from both linear instability and nonlinear stability analyses with variable coefficients are numerically solved using the Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method. The equivalence of linear instability and nonlinear stability boundaries is established in the absence of throughflow, while in its presence, the subcritical instability is shown to be evident. The stability of the system is independent of the direction of throughflow in the case of constant viscosity, whereas upflow is found to be more stabilizing than downflow when the viscosity is varying with depth. While the viscosity parameter offers a destabilizing influence on the onset of convection in the absence of throughflow, it imparts both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on the same in its presence. The influence of the ratio of permeabilities and the interphase momentum transfer parameter is to make the system more stable. The findings of a mono-disperse porous medium are presented as a specific case within the broader context of this investigation. © 2024 Author(s).",,Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Porous materials; System stability; Chebyshev; Darcy theory; Depth dependents; Eigenvalue problem; Linear instabilities; Non-linear stabilities; Nonlinear stability analysis; Principle of exchange of stabilities; Throughflow; Variable coefficients; Viscosity,,,,,,We express our gratitude to anonymous referees whose insightful critiques of an earlier draft significantly contributed to enhancing the quality of this work.

Besides using the significant zero-shot learning capability of state-of-the-art pretrained encoders, this work introduces an alternative external knowledge enhancement strategy based on ChatGPT (chatbot generative pretrained transformer), demonstrating its effectiveness in bridging the intermodal semantic gap. We propose a new concept projection process consisting of three distinct components to capture the intramodal knowledge and intermodal concept gap in the forms of text modality embedding, visual modality embedding, and concept projection embedding. This approach leverages the attention mechanism of the Graph Attention Network for fusing the common aspects of external knowledge related to the knowledge in the text and image modality to implement the concept projection process. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to existing methods. © 2023 The Authors.",cognitive computing; concept projection; knowledge graph; large language models; Memes; metaphor; multimodal machine learning,Cognitive systems; Job analysis; Knowledge graph; Learning systems; Zero-shot learning; Chatbots; Cognitive Computing; Concept projection; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-based systems; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Meme; Metaphor; Multi-modal; Multimodal machine learning; Task analysis; Semantics,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank B.

Herein, we successfully prepared flash graphene (FG)-supported Bi nanoparticles (Bi-NPs/FG) via the ultrafast and ecofriendly FJH method in less than 200 ms for the first time. Benefited from the synergistic effect of highly conductive FG and active Bi nanocrystals, the Bi-NPs/FG hybrid shows a highly selective CO2 electroreduction with an ultrahigh Faradaic efficiency of 93.8% toward C1 product (i.e., formate). Furthermore, the findings from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the reconstruction process not only enhances the bonding strength of the surface Bi-OCHO*, but also optimizes the adsorption energy of the key intermediate (OCHO*), thus benefiting the production of formate. In addition, we conducted an extension study of the FJH route to demonstrate its versatility in preparing a range of other metal/alloy NPs encased in FG. This work presents a feasible pathway to the superfast and massive production of highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion, and it can be extended to other application scenarios with great potential. © 2023 American Chemical Society",,Carbon dioxide; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Nanoparticles; Bismuth nanoparticles; Density-functional theory calculations; Eco-friendly; Electro reduction; Faradaic efficiencies; Heating method; Joules heating; Situ generation; Synergistic effect; Ultra-fast; Graphene,,,,,"ZXL2021273; 202201007, 2022SX00000955; BA2023037; BK20220008; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 22022505, 22033004; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 020514380266, 020514380272, 020514380274","The authors appreciate the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 22022505 and 22033004), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Nos. 020514380266, 020514380272 and 020514380274), the Scientific and Technological Innovation Special Fund for Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20220008), the Scientific and Technological Achievements Transformation Special Fund of Jiangsu Province (No. BA2023037), the International Collaboration Research Program of Nanjing City (Nos. 202201007 and 2022SX00000955), and the Gusu Leading Talent Program of Scientific and Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Wujiang District in Suzhou City (No. ZXL2021273).

In the IOT the wireless sensor network (WSN) part of it. IOT WSN is used to connect the different sensors. Numerous uses for wireless sensor networks are currently being researched. The sensor network usually operates on the batteries. Reducing energy consumption during data transmission and node communication will increase network lifetime. One of the challenging criteria in the IOT is maintaining the energy level for a longer duration. The energy level of the sensor networks is consumed mainly during Base Station (BS) communication, inter-node communication, and data sensing. The proposed approach is a multimodal approach, creates a meta-heuristic optimization strategy to lower the communication's energy-level consumption of the sensor networks. The suggested model will segment the WSN into various clusters. The proposed approach has the combination of the modified LEACH and Modified Cuckoo algorithm to reduce the energy consumption of the WSN-IOT sensor nodes during communication. The modified LEACH algorithm is used to choose the cluster's head (CH). In order to choose the best route from CH to BS, the Modified CUCKOO algorithm is employed. With an ideal number of clusters, balanced energy dissipation, and low-energy consumption, the proposed model can improve network performance. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Base station (BS); Cluster head (CH); Cluster member (CM); CUCKOO; Energy optimization; Fitness function; Internet of Things (IOT); LEACH; M-CS; M-LEACH; Meta-heuristic; Wireless sensor network (WSN),Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Leaching; Low power electronics; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Base station; Cluster head; Cluster member; Cluster-heads; CUCKOO; Energy optimization; Fitness functions; Internet of thing; LEACH; M-CS; M-LEACH; Metaheuristic; Wireless sensor network; Internet of things,,,,,,,,"https://www.elprocus.com/architecture-of-wireless-sensor-network-and-applications/; https://shiverware.com/iot/iot-vs-wsn.html; Singh, S.K., Kumar, P., Singh, J.P., A survey on successors of LEACH protocol (2017) IEEE Access, 5, pp. 4298-4328. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2666082; Sharma, R., Jain, G., Gupta, S., Enhanced cluster-head selection using round robin technique in WSN (2015) 2015 International Conference on Communication Networks (ICCN).

To achieve the same result, these methods may use various techniques and reasoning. The difficulty is that as the number of inputs increases, certain algorithms tend to perform poorly. Several metrics may be used to assess the quality of any code. The code runtime complexity is one of these measurements. To determine this runtime complexity, substantial study and a thorough understanding of algorithms are necessary, which is a challenging manual undertaking. In this study, the worst-case runtime complexity of codes in programming languages C, Java and Python are calculated as Big-O notations utilising code features like Abstract Syntax Trees, ML approaches and static code analysis. The novelty of the research is our labelled runtime complexity dataset which was constructed manually, implementing Deep Learning Algorithms like Bi-LSTM and calculating Code Runtime Complexity for the worst-case scenario as Big-O notations for codes in three languages, C, Java and Python. To predict the runtime complexity for a given code more accurately than the traditional legacy methods such as manually asserting code runtime complexity or running code for different amounts of input, we have presented a more effective manner for the same. The results portray that the XGBoost classifier outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 96%. The current study can also be extended to other high-level programming languages, including more training samples and making use of graph neural networks. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Abstract Syntax Tree; AST; Bi-LSTM; graph2vec; LSTM; Runtime complexity; Static analysis,C (programming language); Complex networks; Java programming language; Long short-term memory; Static analysis; Syntactics; Trees (mathematics); Abstract Syntax Trees; AST; Bi-LSTM; Coding algorithms; Graph2vec; LSTM; Programming languages - C++; Run time complexity; Static code analysis; Worst case scenario; Python,,,,,,,,"(2022) A (2022) Welcome to the Big O Notation Calculator!, , https://shunnarski.github.io/BigO.html.

This means that the content that is interacted with online may subconsciously have a significant effect on one’s mental health. This paper presents a novel approach to detect the mental health state of a user by analyzing their online activity over a period of time and generating a report indicating the same. The user is then allowed to ask any clarifying questions on the generated report, along with general queries on mental health via a chat-bot interface. In order to classify the mental state of the user based on the kind of content posted or interacted with by them, their tweets are scraped and feature vectors of the same are generated. Supervised machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and neural network-based models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are compared for their performance on prediction. A transfer learning approach is also attempted and gives promising results in predicting the classes of the tweets.

The complex structure is realized through additive manufacturing technique. The inherent advantage of these lattices is offering a high strength-to-weight ratio. When embedded with vibration suppressing units at the nodes, these lattices aid in alleviating the overall dynamic response of the structure. The base structure is analyzed for its modal behavior by analytical and experimental means. These results are well correlated. This base lattice configuration is embedded with vibration suppression units at node locations in various spatial distribution patterns. All configurations have been subjected to dynamic characterization through experimental modal analysis and evaluated their effectiveness in suppressing the overall modal response. Finally, an optimal spatial distribution pattern is arrived, exhibiting the maximum benefit in terms of overall vibration reduction and with the most negligible weight penalty. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Additive manufacturing; Chiral structure; Dynamic characterization; Impact loading; Modal analysis,3D printing; Additives; Spatial distribution; Chiral structures; Complexes structure; Dynamic characterization; High-strength; Impact loadings; Manufacturing techniques; Multiple response; Simple++; Spatial distribution patterns; Strength to weight ratio; Modal analysis,,,,,,,,"Chenl, L., Yi, H., Optimization of natural frequency for hexachiral structure based on response surface method (2020) J Vibroeng, 22 (7); Spadoni, A., Ruzzene, M., Numerical and experimental analysis of the static compliance of chiral truss-core airfoils (2007) J Mech Mater Struct, 2 (5); Airoldi A, Bettini P, Zazzarini M, Scarpa F.

However, there is limited understanding of the impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on its structure and function. Through an exhaustive in-silico investigation 12 harmful nsSNPs were predicted from a pool of 172 acquired from the NCBI dbSNP database using 12 established tools that detects deleterious SNPs. Consistently, these nsSNPs were discovered in locations with high levels of conservation. Notably, the three harmful nsSNPs F67C, A83T, and T138I were situated in the active/binding site of GSK-3β, which may affect the protein's capacity to bind to substrates and other proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the F67C and T138I mutants had stable structures, indicating rigidness, whereas the A83T mutant was unstable. Analysis of secondary structures revealed different modifications in all mutant forms, which may affect the stability, functioning, and interactions of the protein. These mutations appear to alter the structural dynamics of GSK-3β, which may have functional ramifications, such as the formation of novel secondary structures and variations in coil-to-helix transitions. In conclusion, this study illuminates the possible structural and functional ramifications of these GSK-3 nsSNPs, revealing how protein compactness, stiffness, and interactions may affect biological activities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",GSK3β; In-silico analysis; Molecular dynamics; Mutation; Wound healing,"Amino acids; Proteins; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structure (composition); Computational analysis; GSK3β; In-silico; In-silico analyse; Multifunctional protein; Mutation; Secondary structures; Silico analysis; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Wound healing; Molecular dynamics; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; alpha helix; Article; binding site; carcinogenicity; cell function; cell migration; clinical evaluation; computer model; controlled study; gene mutation; genetic conservation; genetic variability; human; missense mutation; molecular dynamics; personalized medicine; prediction; protein domain; protein function; protein metabolism; protein modification; protein protein interaction; protein stability; protein structure; single nucleotide polymorphism; validation study; wound healing; bioinformatics; genetics; wound healing; Computational Biology; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Wound Healing",,glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST: JCB/2019/000008; Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR: 5/13/53/2020-NCD-III; Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, IIT KGP","The authors would like to acknowledge all the computational biologists and bioinformaticians all around the globe for making open-access web servers for the analysis of biological data.

FAK is a promising therapeutic target for cellular adhesion-related disorders, such as cancer. Methods: In this study, in silico techniques like quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), Molecular Docking, and Dynamic Simulation were used to study the interactions between small molecules and FAK. Results: The constructed QSAR model showed good statistical parameters (Q2=0.8040 and R2=0.8499), indicating that it is stable and reliable. Based on this model, several new compounds were screened from small molecule databases and their inhibitory activities were validated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Pharmacokinetic parameters were checked using in silico ADME testing. Conclusion: Results show that the protein-ligand complexes are stable during the simulation and are considered potential inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.",ADME; dynamic simulation; Focal adhesion kinase (FAK); molecular docking; protein-ligand; QSAR,focal adhesion kinase; focal adhesion kinase inhibitor; Article; computer model; drug screening; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; pharmacokinetic parameters; quantitative structure activity relation,,,,,"Vision Group on Science and Technology, VGST","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the VGST, Bangalore under Research Project.

Among the triad of metabolites, fipronil sulfone exhibits quantitatively predominant production. Research on Fipronil and its relationship with Parkinson's disease (PD) has exclusively focused on the parent compound (fipronil), with no consideration given to its metabolites. We aim to investigate the effect of fipronil sulfone, on gut bacterial proteins involved in metabolite production, adversely affect patients with Parkinson’s disease. The proteins Diaminopimelate epimerase (Q88V90) (DapF) from Lactobacillus sp., and. Tyrosine Decarboxylase (P0DTQ4) (TDC) from Enterococcus sp. are involved in cellular mechanisms help bacteria maintain a normal functional state & cell population to produce metabolites. The interaction of FS with DapF and TDC for each bacterial species was simulated. A concentration-based simulation was performed for 100 ns at 92 mg/L, half the LD50 value (184 mg/L) of Fipronil sulfone. The values of molecular simulation analysis of TDC and DapF respectively were: RMSD = 4.9846 nm & 2.0648 nm and RMSF = 1.788071 nm & 1.237829 nm. The aforementioned interaction studies indicate conformation change in the protein structures of DapF and TDC could potentially inhibit the functioning of the bacteria, thereby reducing amount of metabolites produced possibly influencing Parkinson’s Disease. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Enterococcus faecalis; Fipronil sulphone; Lactobacillus plantarum; Parkinson’s Disease; pesticides,Amino acids; Biomolecules; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Molecular dynamics; Proteins; Sulfur compounds; Dynamics simulation; Enterococcus faecalis; Fipronil; Fipronil sulphone; Lactobacillus plantarum; Microbiome; Parent compounds; Parkinson's disease; Parkinson’s disease; Simulation studies; Metabolites,,,,,,,,"Chapman, J.R., Balasubramanian, D., Tam, K., Using quantitative spectrometry to understand the influence of genetics and nutritional perturbations on the virulence potential of Staphylococcus aureus (2017) Mol Cell Proteomics, 16, pp. S15-S28; Burgui, S., Gil, C., Solano, C., A systematic evaluation of the two-component systems network reveals that ArlRS is a key regulator of catheter colonization by Staphylococcus aureus (2018) Front Microbiol, 9, p. 342; Tam, K., Torres, V.J., Staphylococcus aureus secreted toxins and extracellular enzymes (2019) Microbiol Spectr, 7; Cryan, J.F., O'Riordan, K.J., Cowan, C.S.M., The microbiota-Gut-brain axis (2019) Physiol Rev, 99 (4), pp. 1877-2013; Knight, E., Geetha, T., Burnett, D., The role of diet and dietary patterns in Parkinson's disease (2022) Nutrients, 14 (21), p. 4472; Villageliú, D., Lyte, M., Dopamine production in Enterococcus faecium: a microbial endocrinology-based mechanism for the selection of probiotics based on neurochemical-producing potential (2018) PLoS One, 13 (11). , PMID: 30485295; PMCID: PMC6261559; Zhang, Y., He, X., Mo, C., Association between microbial tyrosine decarboxylase gene and levodopa responsiveness in patients with Parkinson disease (2022) Neurology, 99, pp. e2443-e2453. , 22; Maini Rekdal, V., Bess Elizabeth, N., Bisanz Jordan, E., Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism (2019) Science, 364 (6445). , et al; Tamtaji, O.R., Taghizadeh, M., Daneshvar, K.R., Clinical and metabolic response to probiotic administration in people with Parkinson's disease: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (2019) Clin Nutr, 38 (3), pp. 1031-1035; Indrio, F., Riezzo, G., Raimondi, F., Lactobacillus reuteri accelerates gastric emptying and improves regurgitation in infants (2011) Eur J Clin Invest, 41, pp. 417-422; Krygowska-Wajs, A., Cheshire, W.P., Wszolek, Z.K., Evaluation of gastric emptying in familial and sporadic Parkinson disease (2009) Parkinsonism Relat D, 15, pp. 692-696; Hardoff, R., Sula, M., Tamir, A., Soil, A., Front, A., Badarna, S., Honigman, S., Giladi, N., Gastric emptying time and gastric motility in patients with Parkinson’s disease (2001) Mov Disord, 16, pp. 1041-1047. , [CrossRef] [PubMed]; Doi, H., Sakakibara, R., Sato, M., Plasma levodopa peak delay and impaired gastric emptying in Parkinson's disease (2012) J Neurol Sci, 319 (1-2), pp. 86-88; Caporaso, J.G., Lauber, C.L., Costello, E.K., Moving pictures of the human microbiome (2011) Genome Biol, 12, p.

The arm can be controlled using live voice instructions, and the system has been designed to work with both English and Kannada voice commands. The image model used for speech recognition predicts audio labels based on spectrograms, and the system transfers the prediction to the microcontroller using a serial port connection. The microcontroller then moves the arm based on the instructions received. The system is designed to be accessible to people of all backgrounds, regardless of their educational level or other factors. The project has the potential to make a significant impact by enabling people to use robotics to perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. The work describes the use of four predefined English and Kannada commands to assess the success rate of speech recognition using machine learning models, specifically the ANN and the CNN. The accuracy of the models was evaluated and compared for both the English and Kannada datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.",Native language; Serial communication; Spectrogram; Speech recognition,Microcontrollers; Robotic arms; Spectrographs; Educational levels; Image modeling; ITS applications; Native language; Rate of speech; Serial communications; Serial port; Spectrograms; Speech recognition technology; Voice command; Speech recognition,,,,,,,,"(2016) Bipin, , B.: Voice and gesture controlled robotic ARM; Naik, A., Abraham, A., (2020) Arduino Based Voice Controlled Robotic Arm; Mishra, P., Patel, R., Upadhyaya, T., Desai, A., (2017) Development of Robotic Arm Using Arduino UNO; Lajish, V.L., Vivek, P., Sunil Kumar, R.K., (2014) Malayalam Speech Controlled Multipurpose Robotic Arm; Punitha, D., P., Hemakumar (2014) G.: Speaker Dependent Continuous Kannada Speech Recognition Using HMM; Megalingam, R.K., Vivek, G.V., Bandyopadhyay, S., Rahi, M.J., (2017) Robotic Arm Design, Development and Control for Agriculture Applications; Al Ahasan, M.A., Awal, M.A., Mostaf, S.S., (2011) Implementation of Speech Recognition Based Robotic System; Ligutan, D.D., Abad, A.C., Dadios, E.P., (2018) Adaptive Robotic Arm Control Using Artificial Network, , Manila; Gupta, D., Bansal, P., Choudhary, K., The state of the art of feature extraction techniques in speech recognition (2018) Speech and Language Processing for Human-Machine Communications, , Agrawal, S., Devi, A., Wason, R., Bansal, P.

The objective of this paper is to review the methods that have been done for knowing the uplift resistance and lateral resistance of pedestal piles. Investigations by different methods such as experimental studies and numerical and analytical studies have been done by various researchers in order to evaluate the response of a belled pile. These methods are discussed in this paper and the comparison with straight shaft piles is based upon the test and analysis. The results indicated that the uplift resistance and lateral resistance were significantly increased with the adoption of belled piles than straight shaft piles. © 2024, Deep Foundations Institute.",Pedestal pile; Pile foundations; Straight shaft pile; Uplift resistance,Numerical methods; Pile foundations; Analytical studies; Belled pile; Lateral loads; Lateral resistance; Offshore environments; Pedestal pile; Straight shaft pile; Transmission line towers; Uplift load; Uplift resistance; Piles,,,,,,,,"Amaresha, R.K.S., Raju, K.V.S.B., (2020) Lateral Resistance of Belled Pile Embedded in Sand, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-6832-9_22; Gao, G., Gao, M., Chen, Q., Yang, J., Field load testing study of vertical bearing behavior of a large diameter belled cast-in-place pile (2019) KSCE J Civ Eng, 23 (5). , https://doi.org/10.1007/s12205-019-2065-z; Han, Y., Cheng, J., Zheng, W., Ding, S., (2021) Estimating the Uplift Bearing Capacity of Belled Piers Adjacent to Sloping Ground by Numerical Modeling Based on Field Tests; Honda, T., Hirai, Y., Sato, E., Uplift capacity of belled and multi-belled piles in dense sand (2011) Soils Found, 51 (3), pp. 483-496. , https://doi.org/10.3208/sandf.51.483; Kong, G., Peng, H., Qin, H., Wang, L., Meng, Y., Ultimate lateral bearing capacity and group effect of belled wedge pile groups (2019) KSCE J Civ Eng, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s12205-019-0173-4; Kong, G.Q., Gu, H.W., Che, P., Ren, L.W., Peng, H.F., Impact of pile shaft shapes on vertical bearing capacity of belled piles (2017) Yantulixue/Rock Soil Mech, 38 (2), pp. 361-367. , https://doi.org/10.16285/j.rsm.2017.02.008; Li, G., Zhang, J., Liu, J., Study on the uplift bearing capacity of belled piles (2019) IOP Conf Ser: Earth Environ Sci, 376 (1). , https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/376/1/012004; Liu, G., Zhang, Z., Cui, Q., Peng, J., Cai, M., Uplift behavior of belled piles subjected to static loading (2021) Arab J Sci Eng, 46 (5), pp. 4369-4385. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13369-020-04779-x; Moayedi, H., Mosallanezhad, M., Uplift resistance of belled and multi-belled piles in loose sand (2017) Measurement, 109, pp. 346-353. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2017.06.001; Moghaddas Tafreshi, S.N., Javadi, S., Dawson, A.R., Influence of geocell reinforcement on uplift response of belled piles (2014) Acta Geotech, 9 (3), pp. 513-528. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11440-013-0300-1; Qian, Z.-Z., Lu, X.-L., Han, X., Tong, R.-M., Interpretation of uplift load tests on belled piers in Gobi gravel (2015) Can Geotech J, 52 (7), pp. 992-998. , https://doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2014-0075; Qian, Z.-Z., Lu, X.L., Yang, W.-Z., (2017) Comparative Field Tests on Straight-Sided and Belled Piers on Sloping Ground under Combined Uplift and Lateral Loads; Schafer, M., Madabhushi, S.P.G., Uplift Resistance of Enlarged Base Pile Foundations (2019) Indian Geotechnical Journal, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s40098-019-00369-3; Yang, Y.S., Qiu, L.C., MPM simulation of uplift resistance of enlarged base piles in sand (2020) Soils Found, 60 (5), pp. 1322-1330. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sandf.2020.08.003","Shubha, M.; PES UniversityIndia; email: shubham@pes.edu",Krishna A.M.Banerjee S.Pitchumani N.K.,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"11th Annual conference on Deep Foundation Technologies for Infrastructure Development in India, DFI India 2022",15 September 2022 through 17 September 2022,,304189,23662557,9.78303E+12,,,English,Lect.

Addition of Li2O modifies the phosphate network and generates non-bridging oxygens in the glass structure. The observed increase in dc conductivity is due to the enhancement in the structural volume, consequently the percolation paths are widened as result of volume increasing effect caused by isotropic dissolution of Li2SO4. This dissolution facilitates easier mobility of Li+ ions. A.C conductivity obeys the Jonscher power law and the power law exponent ‘s’ exhibits a minimum and shows temperature dependence. s is in the range of 0.525—0.549, activation energy for d.c conductivity is in the range of 1.07—0.58 eV and activation energy for a.c conductivity is the range of 1.20—0.60 eV. The conductivity relaxation process is explained using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts stretched exponential correlation function. Further, the scaling of both conductivity and electrical modulus data showed an excellent collapse onto a single curve indicating a single ion transport mechanism operating in these glasses. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",A.C conductivity; Activation energy; Dielectric relaxation; Microwave synthesis; Phospho-vanadate glass,Dielectric relaxation; Dissolution; Glass; Ions; Lithium compounds; Solvents; Temperature distribution; Vanadium pentoxide; A.C conductivity; D.c.

The first DNN is designed to obtain an optimal beamforming weight vector that maximizes the achievable sum rate over the IRS-aided network. The beamforming vector is designed based on a pilot-based channel estimation procedure, which requires only a small fraction of the available number of reflecting surfaces on the IRS to be active. The obtained vector is fed to the second DNN, which is designed for detecting information symbols from the transmitter. Our simulation study shows that the achievable rate obtained using the designed beamforming vector approaches the maximum achievable rate quickly, as the number of active elements increases. The impact of the number of active elements and the beamforming vector on the performance of the detector is also studied, in terms of the bit error rate (BER). We show that the BER performance of the second DNN is close to that of the optimal maximum likelihood detector.

These nanoparticles have shown promising potential in two key applications: photocatalytic degradation of industrial dye effluents and electrochemical sensing of ciprofloxacin. The study found that Arundinaria gigantea leaf extract is an effective reducing agent for synthesizing well-defined crystalline structure CuO nanoparticles, with an average size of 36 nm. The CuO nanoparticles have demonstrated high efficiency in photocatalytic applications, effectively degrading AR88 dye under UV irradiation, making them a viable solution for eco-friendly water purification. Additionally, when incorporated into an electrochemical sensor, these CuO nanoparticles have improved sensitivity and selectivity in detecting ciprofloxacin in aqueous solutions with high accuracy and precision. This study emphasizes the versatility and effectiveness of green-synthesized CuO nanoparticles for various practical uses. © 2023 The Authors",AR88 dye; CuO; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical sensing; Green synthesis; Photocatalysis,,,,,,,,,"Al-Asadi, S.T., Al-Qaim, F.F., Application of response surface methodology on efficiency of fig leaf activated carbon for removal of methylene blue dye (2023) Eurasian Chem.

In this method, accuracy is compromised to achieve high performance. The main criterion is to reduce hardware complexity, power dissipation, and timing delay at the cost of accuracy. The main aim of this paper is to design and analyze two approximate compressors with minimum hardware complexity, delay, and power with reasonable accuracy, when compared with the existing compressors in literature. The proposed designs are implemented and verified using 90 nm Cadence NC-Verilog standard library cells. The parameters of interest in the approximate computing are Error Rate (ER), Error Distance (ED), and Accurate Output Count (AOC). The proposed compressors are used to implement 8 × 8, 16 × 16 unsigned multipliers, and signed 8 × 8 approximate multipliers. The application of the proposed design in image smoothing, multiplication, and LIF neuron modeling is discussed. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Approximate 4:2 compressors;

The authors propose three novel, simple, and entropy-based detectors for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio. The authors evaluate the probability of detection of these three detectors: Vasicek's entropy detector, truncated Vasicek's entropy detector, and Van Es' entropy detector, over a predefined probability of false-alarm. In particular, the authors provide the approximate and asymptotic test statistics for these detectors in the presence and absence of Nakagami-m fading, noise variance uncertainty, and optimised detection threshold. Furthermore, the authors provide a detailed comparison study among all the detectors via Monte Carlo simulations and justify authors results through real-world data. The authors’ experimental results establish a superior performance of truncated Vasicek's entropy detector over Vasicek's entropy detector, energy detector, differential entropy detector and Van Es' entropy detector in practically viable scenarios. © 2023 The Authors.
